Windows Subsystem for Linux
"""
The Windows Subsystem for Linux lets developers run Linux environments 
-- including most command-line tools, utilities, and applications -- directly on Windows, 
unmodified, without the overhead of a virtual machine.

Libtool
"""
GNU Libtool simplifies your job by encapsulating both the platform-specific dependencies, 
and the user interface, in a single script. 
GNU Libtool is designed so that the complete functionality of 
each host type is available via a generic interface, but nasty quirks are hidden from the programmer.

15.3.7 File name conversion
In certain situations, libtool must convert file names and paths between formats appropriate to different platforms. 
Usually this occurs when cross-compiling, and affects only the ability to launch host platform 
executables on the build platform using an emulation or API-enhancement environment such as Wine. 
Failure to convert paths (see File Name Conversion Failure) will cause a warning to be issued, 
but rarely causes the build to fail—and should have no affect on the compiled products, 
once installed properly on the host platform. For more information, see Cross compiling.
However, file name conversion may also occur in another scenario: 
when using a Unix emulation system on Windows (such as Cygwin or MSYS), 
combined with a native Windows compiler such as MinGW or MSVC. 
Only a limited set of such scenarios are currently supported; 
in other cases file name conversion is skipped. 
The lack of file name conversion usually means that uninstalled executables can’t be launched, 
but only rarely causes the build to fail (see File Name Conversion Failure).

libtool supports file name conversion in the following scenarios:

build platform	host platform	Notes
MinGW (MSYS)	MinGW (Windows)		see Native MinGW File Name Conversion
Cygwin		MinGW (Windows)		see Cygwin/Windows File Name Conversion
Unix + Wine	MinGW (Windows)		Requires Wine. See Unix/Windows File Name Conversion.
MinGW (MSYS)	Cygwin			Requires LT_CYGPATH. See LT_CYGPATH. Provided for testing purposes only.
Unix + Wine	Cygwin			Requires both Wine and LT_CYGPATH, but does not yet work with Cygwin 1.7.7 and Wine-1.2. See Unix/Windows File Name Conversion, and LT_CYGPATH.

As expected, cross-compiling
in the Windows Subsystem for Linux is not supported by libtool, because it's seen as a native Linux
and currently in some distro from the store (e.g. Ubuntu) it is 
not possibile to install winepath.
In this case the Perl script here simply (and really simply!) 
takes an input path and mimic the winepath -w under native Linux.
You should put it under where libtool can read it (e.g. /usr/local/bin).
