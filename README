Public domain.  Originally written 2005 by Karl Berry.

For a high-level overview of building TeX Live, see
http://tug.org/texlive/build.html.  In brief:

- To configure and make the source tree, run ./Build.
  This builds in subdirectory Work/, and installs into subdirectory inst/.

- To build (mostly) without optimization, run ./Build --debug.

- If the make fails and you want to rebuild without starting from scratch:
  cd Work/whatever/subdir && make

Email tlbuild@tug.org if problems.

(Nearly everything the Build script does can be overridden via
environment variables; just take a look to see the names.)

Many more details about the TL build system, such as configuring to work
on a single program, adding new programs or libraries, documentation
about the many pieces of the system, etc., are in the doc/tlbuild*
document and the sibling README* files here (which are generated from
that document).
