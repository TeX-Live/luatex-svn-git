Here are some ideas for improvements.  If you would like to contribute,
please send mail to tex-k@tug.org first.

Kpathsea has never officially been released as a standalone library,
even though in practice it is used that way by OS distributions.
It would be good to support a standalone release.

It would be cleaner to always do a case-insensitive search for all
suffixes, instead explicitly listing (for example) both ".otf" and ".OTF".

For multiple texmf.cnf files (or multiple dvips configuration files),
replace extra :'s by the value from the next file in the path, rather
than the value from the next level. But compatibility probably requires
that this not be done.

Support runtime registration of file types to search for, not just
compile-time. Either by a procedure call, or by reading a configuration
file. Implies putting the envvar list into the kpse_format_info_type struct.

cd during filesystem operations, to minimize the pathname
length. Implies always using xgetwd.
