This directory contains the Kpathsea[rch] library, which implements
generic path searching, configuration, and TeX-specific file searching.

See `NEWS' for changes by release, `ChangeLog` for all changes.
See `PROJECTS' for future improvements you might consider working on.

The principal mailing list is http://lists.tug.org/tex-k.
Kpathsea is maintained as part of TeX Live, http://tug.org/texlive.

The top-level headers are `pathsearch.h' for the generic path searching
support, and `tex-{file,glyph}.h' for the TeX-specific support.
