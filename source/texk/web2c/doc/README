This directory contains the Texinfo manual for Web2c, which includes
nodes for all the TeX system programs in the distribution.

The man pages are no longer supported, and are no longer in the distribution.
I do not wish to take the time to maintain the same documentation in two
source formats.  If you want to volunteer to keep the man pages in sync
with the Texinfo manual, let me know.
