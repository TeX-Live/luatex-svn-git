.SH NAME
gftype \- translate a generic font file for humans to read
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B gftype
.RB [ \-i ]
.RB [ \-m ]
.I gf_file_name
.RI [ output_file_name ]
.\"=====================================================================
.SH DESCRIPTION
This manual page is not meant to be exhaustive.  The complete
documentation for this version of \*(TX can be found in the info file
or manual
.IR "Web2C: A TeX implementation" .
.PP
The
.B gftype
program
translates a
.I gf
(generic font) file output by, for example,
.BR mf (1),
to a file that humans can read.
It also serves as a
.I gf
file-validating
program (i.e., if
.B gftype
can read it, it's correct) and as an example of a
.IR gf -reading
program for other software that wants to read
.I gf
files.
.PP
The
.I gf_file_name
on the command line must be complete. Because
the resolution is part of the extension, it would not make
sense to append a default extension as is done with \*(TX or
DVI-reading software. If no
.I output_file_name
is specified, the output goes to
.IR stdout .
.\"=====================================================================
.SH OPTIONS
The output file includes
bitmap images of the characters, if
.B \-i
is given on the command line, and a symbolic listing of the
.I gf
commands, if
.B \-m
is specified.
.\"=====================================================================
.SH ENVIRONMENT
.B gftype
looks for
.I gf_file_name
using the
environment variable GFFONTS.  If that is not set, it uses the variable
TEXFONTS.  If that is not set, it uses the system default.

.SH AUTHORS
David Fuchs and Don Knuth wrote the program.  It was published as
part of the
.I \*(MFware
technical report, available from the \*(TX Users Group.
Paul Richards originally ported it to Unix.
