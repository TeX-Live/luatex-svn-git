.SH "DESCRIPTION" 
.PP 
\fBofm2opl\fP translates a binary Omega Font Metrics file,
\fIofmname\fP, into a human-readable property-list form\&.  The
program writes to standard output (by default) or to a file specified
as \fIoplfile\fP\&.
.PP 
The program also works with TeX TFM files, producing TeX PL files\&.
.PP 
.SH "OPTIONS" 
.PP 
(Same as \fBovf2ovp\fP).
.IP 
.IP "\fB-charcode-format=\fP\fItype\fP" 
output character codes according to \fItype\fP,
either `hex\&', `octal\&' or `ascii\&'\&.  Default is
`hex\&'\&; `ascii' says to use
ASCII for letters and digits, hex for all else\&.
.IP "\fB-char-format=\fP\fIstype\fP"
output character codes according to \fIstype\fP,
either `num\&' or `ascii\&'\&. Default is `num'; `ascii' as in
-charcode-format.  (These two redundant options both exist only for
historical compatibility.)
.IP "\fB-num-format=\fP\fIntype\fP"
output numbers according to \fIntype\fP,
either `hex' or `octal'; default is hex.
.IP "\fB-text-format=\fP\fIttype\fP"
output coding scheme and family according to \fIttype\fP,
either `mixed' or `upper' case; default is mixed.
.IP "\fB-help\fP" 
display a brief summary of syntax and options 
.IP "\fB-verbose\fP" 
display progress reports
.IP "\fB-version\fP" 
output version information and exit
.IP

.IP "\fIOFMNAME\fP"

.IP "\fIOPLFILE\fP" 
an Omega Property List file

.SH "BUGS" 
.PP 
Send bug reports to <http://lists.tug.org/tex-k>
(mailing list); may also check if the same bug is present in
\fBtftopl\fP(1)\&.  General discussion of Omega (and Aleph) can take place
on the <http://lists.tug.org/omega> mailing list.

.SH "AUTHOR" 
.PP 
According to the WEB documentation:
.PP 
.RS 
The first \fBTFtoPL\fP program was designed by Leo Guibas in the
summer of 1978\&.  Contributions by Frank Liang, Doug Wyatt, and Lyle
Ramshaw also had a significant effect on the evolution of the present
code\&.
.PP 
Extensions for an enhanced ligature mechanism were added by D\&.E\&. Knuth
in 1989\&.
.PP 
Extensions to handle extended font metric files (``OFM\&'\&') were added
by John Plaice in December 1995 and January 1996, resulting in the new
program \fBOFM2OPL\fP\&.
.RE 
.PP
\fBofm2opl\fP is based on the WEB source code for \fBtftopl\fP(1),
although nowadays it is a link to \fBomfonts\fP, implemented entirely in
C.
.PP 
The primary authors of Omega are John Plaice and Yannis Haralambous.
Omega (and Aleph) are now maintained as part of TeX Live.
