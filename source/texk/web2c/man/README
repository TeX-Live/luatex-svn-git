(This file written by Nelson H. F. Beebe <beebe@math.utah.edu>.)

This directory contains UNIX manual pages for TeXware and MFware.

Here are some guidelines for writing UNIX manual page files, based on
the standards used by Sun Microsystems.  The manual pages in this
directory have been revised to conform to these guidelines.

*** The sections of a manual page are identified by these headings:

.TH PROGRAM 1 "dd month yyyy"
.SH NAME
.SH SYNOPSIS
.SH DESCRIPTION
.SH OPTIONS
.SH ENVIRONMENT
.SH FILES
.SH "SEE ALSO"
.SH AUTHOR

Additional sections may be supplied, but the above section order
should be preserved.  If you are adding a new section, try to find
several examples in existing UNIX manual pages to justify the header
name you choose.

To improve readability of the [nt]roff man page files in this
directory, each section header has been prefixed by a comment line of
the form
.\"=====================================================================


------------------------------------------------------------------------

*** The

.TH PROGRAM 1 "dd month yyyy"

line should be the first [nt]roff dotted command in the .man file,
other than comments, which begin with the 3-character sequence .\".

The PROGRAM name should be spelled entirely in uppercase letters.

The single character following PROGRAM is the manual page section,
generally 1 for user commands.  Any character from the set [1-8nl] is
recognized by the UNIX man command, but the sections have specific
meanings (1=user commands, 2=system calls, 3=library routines, 4=special
files, 5=file formats and conventions, 6=games, 7=macro packages and
language conventions, 8=maintenance, l=local, and n=new).

Historically, man page files were stored in /usr/man/man[1-8nl], with
local additions to /usr/man/manl.  That approach offered no
subdivision of local additions into sections, so the trend today is to
leave the /usr/man tree in the state supplied by the vendor, and to
maintain a separate tree, /usr/man/man[1-8nl], to hold local
additions.  Most UNIX man implementations support a MANPATH variable
to specify a search path, such as /usr/man:/usr/local/man.

If your man command doesn't support a MANPATH variable, get the
freely-available man implementation man-1.0.tar.Z available on several
Internet archive sites, including gatekeeper.dec.com in
/.8/GNU/man-1.0.tar.Z.  Some bugs exist in that version, and fixes were
supplied to the program's author on 12 December 1992, so look for a new
version, or ask Nelson Beebe <beebe@math.utah.edu> for a set of patches.
This new man implementation has some nice features, including support
for compressed files, and checking of formatted and raw file time stamps
to decide whether to reformat or not.  Furthermore, it can be configured
to use either [nt]roff, or GNU groff; some UNIX vendors charge extra for
[nt]roff, so groff may offer a cheaper man page implementation.

The last argument to .TH is the date in the form 01 December 1992; the
month is NOT abbreviated.


------------------------------------------------------------------------

*** Following
.SH NAME
should be a single line with NO macros, such as

bibtex \- make a bibliography for (La)TeX

This line is very important, because it is used by the "man -k" and
"apropos" commands to look up commands by keywords; every word in the
line is a potential keyword match.


------------------------------------------------------------------------

*** Following
.SH SYNOPSIS
there should be one or more lines in the form

.B vftovp
[
.B \-verbose
]
[
.BI \-charcode-format =format
]
.I vf_file_name
.I tfm_file_name
[
.I vpl_file_name
]

Program names and option switches are typeset in bold type (.B), and
file names in italics (.I).  Switch values are in italics.

Give option switches in alphabetical order in the SYNOPSIS
section, and their descriptions in the same order in the OPTIONS
section.


------------------------------------------------------------------------

*** Here are some general [nt]roff hints for writing the
.SH DESCRIPTION
section.


*** Separate paragraphs by a .PP command, not by blank lines.


*** When using the multi-font selectors, like .BI (bold, then italic),
remember that fonts alternate in the following space-separated words:

.BI aaa bbb ccc ddd

will typeset aaa and cccc in bold, and bbb and ddd in italic, with NO
intervening spaces, so the result here will be aaabbbcccddd.  If you
want spaces between the words, use quotation marks:

.BI "aaa " "bbb " "ccc " ddd

will produce aaa bbb ccc ddd.

Use [nt]roff dotted font change sequences (.I, .B, .BI, .BR, ...)
instead of the \fX...\fP alternatives.  The single exception is when
you need quotation marks in italics, such as \fIsetenv FOOBAR "foo
bar"\fP.


*** Represent en dashes by the current font minus (\-), and use the
same character in front of option switches.  Hyphens in words, as
``multi-font'', are written with the ASCII minus sign.


*** Quotation marks are [nt]roff grouping commands, analogous to curly
braces in TeX files.  They will NOT survive in the formatted output.
If you want typeset quotation marks, use ``phrase'', just as in TeX.


*** Ellipses (...) in [nt]roff are coded as .\|.\|., for the same
reason that \ldots{} is used in TeX instead of ....


*** UNIX is a trademark of AT&T Bell Laboratories and must be spelled
in uppercase letters.


*** Watch out for spaces.  Unlike TeX, [nt]roff preserve ALL input
spaces.  This means you cannot indent [nt]roff input for readability.
Two spaces should follow a sentence-ending period, and otherwise, only
one space should be used.  Tabs are special in [nt]roff; they are used
to separate columns of tables, like & in TeX, and no other character
can be used for that purpose.  The man page files in this directory
contain no tabs, and trailing blanks have been stripped from all
files.


*** Do not used fixed indentation dimensions for displayed material.
Instead, use .RS and .RE to mark the indented paragraphs, with .IP to
separate paragraphs:

.RS
Blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah.
Blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah.
.IP
Blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah.
Blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah.
.RE


*** Use macros for phrases that require special typesetting, such as
the TeX logo, and provide both nroff and troff definitions:

.if n .ds AB nroff-definition
.if t .ds AB troff-definition

Macro names are exactly 2 characters long, and are referenced by \*(
prefixed to their names, e.g. \*(AB.

If a macro expansion requires another macro, it must be given after
that macro.  For example, the BibTeX and LaTeX macros follow the TeX
macro so they can use \*(TX in their definitions.

Suitable macros have been provided for TeX, BibTeX, LaTeX, Metafont,
and Web, and adjusted for troff's default Times Roman typeface to
match their appearance with Computer Modern typefaces.


------------------------------------------------------------------------

*** The 
.SH ENVIRONMENT
section should list all the relevant environment variables, with a brief
description and system defaults if appropriate.


*** Environment variables are spelled in uppercase letters, e.g.,
TEXFONTS, and NO font size changes are made around them.  When font
sizes were changed in the past, many inconsistencies were present, so
the practice has been abandoned.


*** Do not use fixed dimensions for indented labelled paragraphs.
Instead, use the width of the longest label, plus 2n, as follows:

.TP \w'LONGESTLABEL'u+2n
LABEL
Blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah.
.TP
LONGESTLABEL
Blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah.
Blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah.

If the longest label is extremely long, pick a somewhat shorter one so
as to avoid having very short paragraph lines.


------------------------------------------------------------------------

*** Spell TeX control sequences in Roman letters, doubling the
backslash, e.g. \\input, or for better visibility, use italics
with the backslash represented as \e:

.I \einput

Although some [nt]roff implementations support a typewriter font which
is conventional for TeX control sequences, historically only roman,
bold, italic, and special fonts were available.


*** These manual pages in the *.man form are filtered by sedscript to
expand @XYZ@ into something else, producing corresponding *.1 files
which are installed in the system manual page directories. This is
used to insert local paths into the manual pages, so that for example
@TEXINPUTS@ is replaced by the local default TEXINPUTS search path.
Such paths are set at installation time in the top-level Makefile.


*** You can use the UNIX checknr utility to do a rudimentary validation of
your manual page files, e.g.

	checknr -c.BI.BR.IR.IB.RB.RI tex.man

The -c.BI.BR.IR.IB.RB.RI is needed because checknr doesn't know about
the -man document style, and otherwise complains about those font
change commands.  The command "make check" will run checknr with each
of the *.1 files.
