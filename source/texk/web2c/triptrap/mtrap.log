! Number is too large (12000).
l.185 n = 12000

It is at least 4096. Continue and I'll try to cope
with that big value; but it might be dangerous.

! Value is too large (12000).
l.185 n = 12000;
                 show n;
The equation I just processed has given some variable
a value of 4096 or more. Continue and I'll try to cope
with that big value; but it might be dangerous.
(Set warningcheck:=0 to suppress this message.)

! Enormous number has been reduced.
l.187 n:= 40000
               ; show n;
I can't handle numbers bigger than 32767.99998;
so I've changed your constant to that maximum amount.

I've just read as much of that statement as I could fathom,
so a semicolon should have been next. It's very puzzling...
but I'll try to get myself back together, by ignoring
everything up to the next `;'. Please insert a semicolon
now in front of anything that you don't want me to delete.
