(This file is public domain.)

This directory contains Web2c, a system which converts TeX, Metafont,
and other related WEB programs to C.  By itself, it is not a complete,
ready-to-run, TeX distribution, nor is it a general-purpose Pascal-to-C
or WEB-to-C translator.

Web2c no longer exists as a separate distribution.  It is maintained as
part of TeX Live (http://tug.org/texlive).

See `NEWS' for changes by release,
`ChangeLog` for all changes.
`PROJECTS' for some old rainy-day ideas.

If present, see *dir/README for more details on each package.

Web2c is free software.
