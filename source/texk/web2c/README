This directory contains Web2c, a system which converts TeX, Metafont,
and other related WEB programs to C.  By itself, it is not a complete,
ready-to-run, TeX distribution, nor is it a general-purpose Pascal-to-C
or WEB-to-C translator.

Web2c no longer exists as a separate distribution.  It is maintained as
part of TeX Live (http://tug.org/texlive).

Mailing list for bug reports and all general discussion:
https://lists.tug.org/tex-k; anyone can join the list, but it is not
necessary to join to post. Archives are public.

See `NEWS' for changes by release, `ChangeLog` for all changes,
`PROJECTS' for some old rainy-day ideas.
If present, see *dir/README for more details on each package.

Info on building only one of the engines here:
  https://tug.org/texinfohtml/tlbuild.html#Build-one-engine
TeX Live general build info:
  https://tug.org/texlive/build.html
Mailing list for build issues (same setup as tex-k, above):
  https://lists.tug.org/tlbuild

The original TeX and Metafont programs by Donald Knuth are public domain.
Web2c is free software.
