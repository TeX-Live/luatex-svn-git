## pplib - pdf disassembling library for LuaTeX

This is `plib` - PDF disassembling library for LuaTeX (http://luatex.org)

The library has no LuaTeX dependency, it depends only on `zlib`.
However, `pplib` was tailor-made for LuaTeX and its functionals are
somewhat limited (eg. read-only PDF support).
