This directory auxdir/auxsub/ of the TL tree does not build or install
anything.  Its purpose is to record the command line used to invoke
auxdir/auxsub/configure.  This information is then used by the Makefiles in
libs, texk, and utils to invoke configure in their subdirectories without
the need to adjust any absolute or relative paths.
