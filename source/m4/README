This directory is the central repository for Autoconf macros needed to build
the TeX Live (TL) tree. They are incorporated into the configure scripts.

(1) Public macros such as libtool.m4 used to build the libraries and
programs in the TL subdirectories libs/*/, utils/*/, and texk/*/ that are
owned by the TL tree, i.e., either not maintained independently or with a
proxy Makefile.am using an (almost) unmodified source tree and bypassing the
original build system.

Note: the files libtool.m4 and ../build-aux/ltmain.sh must match.

(2) `Public' macros for the TL build system and for the TL libraries in the
subdirectories libs/*/, texk/kpathsea/, and texk/ptexenc/, used to configure
programs and other libraries requiring these TL libraries.  The macros are
designed with the aim that programs maintained independently can be built as
part of the TL tree or without TL (using installed versions of the required
libraries), ideally using the same unmodified sources.

(3) `Private' macros for the TL infrastructure, only used in directories
owned by the TL tree.

kpse-pkgs.m4: defines lists of subdirectories libs/Lib/, utils/Util/, and
	tex/Prog/ with libraries and programs that can be built as part of
	the TL tree.

kpse-setup.m4: macros that walk through these lists to provide configure
	options.  They depend on configure fragments */*/ac/withenable.ac
	defining the dependencies between these libraries and programs.

See also the sibling top-level am/ directory.
