\chapter{Introduction}

\startframedtext[framecolor=red,foregroundcolor=red,width=\hsize,font=\tfa]

This book will eventually become the reference manual of \LUATEX. At
the moment, it simply reports the behaviour of the executable
matching the snapshot or beta release date in the title page.

\blank

Features may come and go. The current version of \LUATEX\ is not meant
for production and users cannot depend on stability, nor on
functionality staying the same.

\blank

Nothing is considered stable just yet. This manual
therefore simply reflects the current state of the executable. {\bs
Absolutely nothing\/} on the following pages is set in stone. When the
need arises, anything can (and will) be changed without prior notice.

\blank

\bf If you are not willing to deal with this situation, you should wait 
for the stable version. Currently we expect the first release to be
available sometime in the summer of~2008.

\stopframedtext

\blank[2*line]

\LUATEX\ consists of a number of interrelated but (still) distinguishable
 parts:

\startitemize[packed]
\item \PDFTEX\ version 1.40.3
\item \ALEPH\ RC4 (from the \TEXLIVE\ repository)
\item \LUA\ 5.1.2 ($+$ coco 1.1.3)
\item Dedicated \LUA\ libraries
\item Various \TEX\ extensions
\item Parts of \FONTFORGE\ 2007.06.07
\item Newly written compiled source code to glue it all together
\stopitemize

Neither \ALEPH's I/O translation processes, nor tcx files, nor
\ENCTEX\ can be used, these encoding|-|related functions are
superseded by a \LUA|-|based solution (reader callbacks).  Also, some
experimental \PDFTEX\ features are removed. These can be implemented
in Lua instead.

\chapter{Basic \TEX\ enhancements}


\section{Version information}

There are three new primitives to test the version of \LUATEX:

\starttabulate[|l|p|]
\NC \bf primitive         \NC \bf explanation \NC\NR
\NC \type{\luatexversion}   \NC A combination of major an minor number, as in pdfTeX. 
                              Current value: {\bf\the\luatexversion} \NC\NR
\NC \type{\luatexrevision}  \NC The revision, as in pdfTeX. 
                              Current value: {\bf\luatexrevision} \NC\NR
\NC \type{\luatexdatestamp} \NC A combination of the local date and hour when
                              the current executable was compiled,
                              the syntax is identical to \tex{luatexrevision}.
                              Value for the executable that generated this 
                              document: {\bf\luatexdatestamp}. \NC\NR
\stoptabulate

Note that the \type{\luatexdatestamp} depends on both the compilation
time and compilation place of the current executable, it is defined in
terms of the local time. The purpose of this primitive is solely to be
an aid in the development process, do not use it for anything besides
debugging.

\section{\UNICODE\ text support}

Text input and output is now considered to be \UNICODE\ text, so
input characters can use the full range of \UNICODE\ ($2^{20}+2^{16} =
\hbox{10FFFF} = 1114111$). 

Later chapters will talk of characters and glyphs. Although these are
not the interchangeable, they are closely related. During typesetting,
a character is always converted to a suitable graphic representation
of that character in a specific font. However, while processing a list
of to-be-typeset nodes, its contents may still be seen as a character.
Inside \LUATEX\ there is not yet a clear separation between the two
concepts yet. Until this is implemented, please do not be too harsh on
us if we make errors in the usage of the terms.
 
Note: for now, it only makes sense to use values above the base plane
(\type{"0xFFFF}) for \tex{mathcode} and \tex{catcode} assignments,
since the hyphenation patterns are still limited to at the most 16-bit
values, so the other commands will not know what to do with those high
values.

A few primitives affected by this, all in a similar fashion: each of
them has to accomodate for a larger range of acceptable numbers.  For
instance, \tex{char} now accepts values between~0 and 1114111. This
should not be a problem for well|-|behaved input files, but it could
create incompatibilities for input that would have generated an error
when processed by older \TEX|-|based engines. The maximum number of
allocations is \type {"10FFFF} or $2^{20}+2^{16}$ (21 bits). The
maximum value that can be assigned are:

\starttabulate[|l|l|l|l|]
\NC \bf primitive     \NC \bf bits \NC \bf hex     \NC \bf numeric                     \NC\NR
\NC \tex{char}        \NC 21       \NC \tt ~10FFFF \NC $2^{20}+2^{16}$                 \NC\NR
\NC \tex{chardef}     \NC 21       \NC \tt ~10FFFF \NC $2^{20}+2^{16}$                 \NC\NR
\NC \tex{lccode}      \NC 21       \NC \tt ~10FFFF \NC $2^{20}+2^{16}$                 \NC\NR
\NC \tex{uccode}      \NC 21       \NC \tt ~10FFFF \NC $2^{20}+2^{16}$                 \NC\NR
\NC \tex{sfcode}      \NC 15       \NC \tt ~~~7FFF \NC $2^{15}$                        \NC\NR
\NC \tex{catcode}     \NC ~4       \NC \tt ~~~~~~F \NC $2^{4}$                         \NC\NR
\stoptabulate

As far as the core engine is concerned, all input and output to text
files is \UTF-8 encoded. Input files can be pre|-|processed using the
\luatex{reader} callback. This will be explained in a later chapter.

Output in byte|-|sized chunks can be achieved by using characters just
outside of the valid unicode range, starting at the value 1.114.112 
(0x110000). When the times comes to print a character $c>=1.114.112$, \LUATEX\ will
actually print the single byte corresponding to $c-1.114.112$.

Output to the terminal uses \type{^^} notation for the lower control
range ($c<32$), with the exception of \type{^^I}, \type{^^J} and
\type{^^M}.  These are considered \quote{safe} and therefore printed as-is.

Normalization of the \UNICODE\ input can be handled by a macro package
during callback processing (this will be explained in \in{section}[iocallback]).

\section{Wide math characters}

Text handling is now extended up to the full \UNICODE\ range, but math mode
deals mostly with glyphs in fonts directly and fonts tend to be 16-bit
at maximum. The extension from 8-bit to 16-bit was already present in
\ALEPH\ by means of a set of extra primitives.

Therefore, the math primitives from \TEX\ and \ALEPH\ are kept mostly
as they are, except for the ones that convert from input to math
commands like \type{matcode} and \type{omathcode}. The traditional
\TEX\ primitives are unchanged, their arguments are upscaled from 8~to 
16~bits internally (as in \ALEPH).

\stoptabulate

\section{Extended tables}

All traditional \TEX\ and \ETEX\ registers can be 16 bit numbers as in \ALEPH. The affected commands
are:

\startcolumns[n=4]
\starttyping
\count
\dimen
\skip
\muskip
\marks
\toks
\countdef
\dimendef
\skipdef
\muskipdef
\toksdef
\box
\unhbox
\unvbox
\copy
\unhcopy
\unvcopy
\wd
\ht
\dp
\setbox
\vsplit
\stoptyping
\stopcolumns

The same is true for the font-related \PDFTEX\ tables like \type{\rpcode} etc.

\section{Attribute registers}

Attributes are a completely new concept in \LUATEX. Syntactically,
they behave a lot like counters: attributes obey \TEX's nesting stack
and can be used after \tex{the} etc.\ just like the normal
\tex{count} registers.

\startsyntax
\attribute <16-bit number> <optional equals> <31-bit number>!crlf
\attributedef <csname> <optional equals> <16-bit number>
\stopsyntax

Conceptually, an attribute is either \quote{set} or \quote{unset}. Set
attributes can only have values of~0 or more, otherwise they are
considered unset and automatically remapped to an special negative
value meaning \quote{unset} (currently that value is $-1$, but please
test on negativity, not on a specific value).  All attributes start
out in the \quote{unset} state (in \INITEX). 

Attributes can be used as extra counter values, but their usefulness
comes mostly from the fact that the numbers and values of all \quote{set}
attributes are attached to all nodes created in their scope. These can
then be queried from any \LUA\ code that deals with node
processing. Future versions of
\LUATEX\ will propably be using specific negative attribute ids for
internal use. Further information about how to use attributes for node
list processing from lua is given in~\in{chapter}[nodes].

\subsection{Box attributes}

Nodes typically receive the list of attributes that is in effect when
they are created. This moment can be quite asynchronous. For example: in
paragraph building, the individual line boxes are created after the
\tex{par} command has been processed, so they will receive the list of
attributes that is in effect then, not the attributes that were in
effect in, say, the first or third line of the paragraph. 

Similar situations happen in \LUATEX\ regularly. A few of the more
obvious problematic cases are dealt with: the attributes for nodes
that are created during hyphenation and ligaturing borrow their
attributes from their surrounding glyphs, and it is possible to
influence box attributes directly. 

But many other inserted nodes, like the nodes resulting from math mode
and alignments, are processed `out of order', and will have the
attributes that are in effect at the precise moment of creation (which
is often later than expected). This area needs studying, and is in
fact one of the reasons for a beta at this moment.


It is possible to fine-tune the list of attributes that are applied
to a \type{hbox}, \type{vbox} or \type{vtop} by the use of the
keyword \type{attr}. An example:

\starttyping
\attribute2=5
\setbox0=\hbox {Hello}
\setbox2=\hbox attr1=12 attr2=-1{Hello}
\stoptyping

This will set the attribute list of the box 2 to $1=12$, and the
attributes of box 0 will be $2=5$. As you can see, assigning a
negative value causes an attribute to be ignored.

The \type{attr} keyword(s) should come before a \type{to} or
\type{spread}, if that is also specified.

\section{\LUA\ related primitives}

In order to merge \LUA\ code with \TEX\ input, a few new primitives are
needed. \LUATEX\ has support for 65536 separate \LUA\ interpreter
states. States are automatically created based on the integer argument
to the primitives \tex{directlua} and \tex{latelua}.


\subsection{\tex{directlua}}

The primitive \tex{directlua} is used to execute \LUA\ code immediately.
The syntax is

\startsyntax
\directlua <16-bit number> <general text>
\stopsyntax

The \syntax{<general text>} is expanded fully, and then fed into the
\LUA\ interpreter state indicated by the \syntax{<16-bit number>}. 
If the state does not exist yet, it will be initialized
automatically. After reading and expansion has been applied to the
\syntax{<general text>}, the resulting token list is converted to a
string as if it was displayed using \type{\the\toks}. On the \LUA\
side, each \type{\directlua} block is treated as a separate chunk. 

The conversion from and to a token list means that you normally can
not use \LUA\ line comments (starting with \type{--}) within the
argument, as there typically will be only one \quote{line}, so that comment
will then run on until the end of the input. You will either need to
use \TEX-style line comments (starting with \%), or change the \TEX\
category codes locally.

\startbuffer
$\pi = \directlua0{tex.print(math.pi)}$
\stopbuffer

The \type{\directlua} command is expandable: the results of the \LUA\
code become effective immediately. As an example, the following
input:
\typebuffer
will result in
\getbuffer

Because the \syntax{<general text>} is a chunk, the normal \LUA\ error
handling is triggered if there is a problem in the included code. The
\LUA\ error messages should be clear enough, but the contextual 
information is still pretty bad. Typically, you will only see the line
number of the right brace at the end of the code. 

While on the subject of errors: some of the things you can do inside
\LUA\ code can break up \LUATEX\ pretty bad. If you are not careful
while working with the node list interface, you may even end up with
assertion errors from within the \TEX\ portion of the executable.

\subsection{\tex{latelua}}

\tex{latelua} stores \LUA\ code in a whatsit that will be processed
inside the output routine. It's intended use is very similar to
\tex{pdfliteral}. Within the \LUA\ code, you can print \PDF\ 
statements directly to the \PDF\ file.

\startsyntax
\latelua <16-bit number> <general text>
\stopsyntax

\subsection{\tex{luaescapestring}}

This primitive converts a \TEX\ token sequence so that it can be
safely used as the contents of a \LUA\ string: embedded backslashes,
double and single quotes, and newlines and carriage returns are
escaped. This is done by prepending an extra token consisting of a
backslash with category code~12, and for the line endings,
converting them to \type{n} and \type{r} respectivelu. The token
sequence is fully expanded.

\startsyntax
\luaescapestring <general text>
\stopsyntax

Most often, this command is not actually the best way to deal with the
differences between the \TEX\ and \LUA. In very short bits of \LUA\
code it is often not needed, and for longer stretches of \LUA\ code it
is easier to keep the code in a separate file and load it using \LUA's
\type{dofile}:
\starttyping
\directlua0 { dofile('mysetups.lua')}
\stoptyping

\subsection{\tex{closelua}}

This primitive allows you to close a \LUA\ state, freeing all of its
used memory.

\startsyntax
\closelua <16-bit number>
\stopsyntax

You cannot close the initial \LUA\ state~(0), attempts to do so
will be silently ignored.

States are never closed automatically except when a fatal out of
memory error occurs, at which point \LUATEX\ will exit anyway.

Also be aware that \LUA\ states are not closed immediately, but only
when the \tex{output} routine comes into play next (because there may be
pending \tex{latelua} calls).

\section{New \ETEX\ primitives}

\subsection{\tex{clearmarks}}

This primitive clears a marks class completely, resetting all three
connected mark texts to empty.

\startsyntax
\clearmarks <16-bit number>
\stopsyntax

\subsection{\tex{noligs} and \tex{nokerns}}

These primitives prohibit ligature and kerning insertion at the time
when the initial node list is built by \LUATEX's main control loop.
They are part of a temporary trick and will be removed in the near
future. For now, you need to enable these primitives when you want to
do node list processing of \quote{characters}, where \TEX's normal
processing would get in the way.

\startsyntax
\noligs <integer>!crlf
\nokerns <integer>
\stopsyntax


\subsection{\tex{formatname}}

\tex{formatname}'s syntax is identical to \tex{jobname}.

In \INITEX, the expansion is empty. Otherwise, the expansion is the
value that \tex{jobname} had during the \INITEX\ run that dumped the
currently loaded format.

\subsection{\tex{scantextokens}}

The syntax of \tex{scantextokens} is identical to \tex{scantokens}.

This is a slightly adapted version of \ETEX's \tex{scantokens}. The
differences are:

\startitemize
\item The last (and usually only) line does not have a
      \tex{endlinechar} appended
\item \tex{scantextokens} never raises an EOF error,
      and it does not execute \tex{everyeof} tokens.
\item The \quote{.. while end of file ..} error tests are not executed, allowing
      the expansion to end on a different grouping level or while a
      conditional is still incomplete.
\stopitemize


\subsection{Catcode tables}

Catcode tables are a new feature that allows you to switch to a
predefined catcode regime in a single statement. You can have a
practically unlimited number of different tables.

The subsystem is backward compatible: if you never use the following
commands, your document will not notice any difference in behavior
compared to traditional \TEX.

The contents of each catcode table is independent of any other
catcode tables, and their contents is stored and retrieved from the
format file.

\subsubsection{\tex{catcodetable}}

\startsyntax
\catcodetable <28-bit number>
\stopsyntax

The \tex{catcodetable} switches to a different catcode table.
Such a table has to be previously created using one of the two
primitives below, or it has to be zero (table zero is initialized by
\INITEX).

\subsubsection{\tex{initcatcodetable}}

\startsyntax
\initcatcodetable <28-bit number>
\stopsyntax

The \tex{initcatcodetable} creates a new table with catcodes
identical to those defined by \INITEX:

\starttabulate[|l|l|l|l|]
\NC~0\NC \type{_}                  \NC         \NC \tt escape        \NC\NR
\NC~5\NC \tt\letterhat\letterhat M \NC return  \NC \tt car\_ret      \NC\NR
\NC~9\NC \tt\letterhat\letterhat @ \NC null    \NC \tt ignore        \NC\NR
\NC10\NC \tt <space>               \NC space   \NC \tt spacer        \NC\NR
\NC11\NC {\tt a} -- {\tt z}        \NC         \NC \tt letter        \NC\NR
\NC11\NC {\tt A} -- {\tt Z}        \NC         \NC \tt letter        \NC\NR
\NC12\NC everything else           \NC         \NC \tt other         \NC\NR
\NC14\NC \tt\letterpercent         \NC         \NC \tt comment       \NC\NR
\NC15\NC \tt\letterhat\letterhat ? \NC delete  \NC \tt invalid\_char \NC\NR
\stoptabulate

The new catcode table is allocated globally: it will not go away after
the current group has ended. If the supplied number is identical to
the currently active table, an error is raised.

\subsubsection{\tex{savecatcodetable}}

\startsyntax
\savecatcodetable <28-bit number>
\stopsyntax

\tex{savecatcodetable} copies the current set of catcodes to a
new table with the requested number. The definitions in this new table
are all treated as if they were made in the outermost level.

The new table is allocated globally: it will not go away after the
current group has ended. If the supplied number is the currently
active table, an error is raised.

\subsection{\tex{suppressfontnotfounderror}}

\startsyntax
\suppressfontnotfounderror = 1
\stopsyntax

If this new integer parameter is non-zero, then \LUATEX\ will not
complain about font metrics that are not found. Instead it will
silently skip the font assignment, making the requested csname for the
font \type{\ifx} equal to \type{\nullfont}, so that it can be tested
against that without bothering the user.

\subsection{Font syntax}

\LUATEX\ will accept a braced argument as a font name:

\starttyping
\font\myfont = {cmr10}
\stoptyping

This allows for embedded spaces, without the need for double quotes.
Macro expansion takes place inside the argument.

\section{Debugging}

If \tex{tracingonline} is larger than 2, the node list displau will
also print the node number of the nodes.

\chapter {\LUA\ general}

\section[init]{Initialization}

\subsection{\LUATEX\ as a \LUA\ interpreter}

There are some situations that make \LUATEX\ behave like it is a \LUA\
interpreter only:
\startitemize[packed]
\item If a \type{--luaonly} option is given on the commandline
\item If the executable is named \type{texlua} (or \type{luatexlua})
\item if the only non|-|option argument (file) on the commandline has the extension
	\type{lua} or \type{luc}.
\stopitemize

In this mode, it will set \LUA's \type{arg[0]} to the found script
name, pushing preceding options in negative values and the rest of the
commandline in the positive values, just like the \LUA\
interpreter.

\LUATEX\ will exit immediately after executing the specified \LUA\
script and is, in effect, a somewhat bulky standalone \LUA\
interpreter with a bunch of extra preloaded libraries.

\subsection{\LUATEX\ as a \LUA\ byte compiler}

There are two situations that make \LUATEX\ behaves like the \LUA\
byte compiler:
\startitemize[packed]
\item If a \type{--luaconly} option is given on the commandline
\item If the executable is named \type{texluac}
\stopitemize

In this mode, \LUATEX\ is exactly like \type{luac} from the standalone
\LUA\ distribution, except that it does not have the \type{-l} switch,
and that it accepts (but ignores) the \type{--luaconly} switch.

\subsection{Other commandline processing}

When the \LUATEX\ executable starts, it looks for the \type{--lua}
commandline option. If there is no \type{--lua} option, the
commandline is interpreted in a similar fashion as in traditional
\PDFTEX\ and \ALEPH. But if the option is present, \LUATEX\ will enter an
alternative mode of commandline parsing in comparison to the standard
web2c programs.

In this mode, a small series of actions is taken in order. At first,
it will only interpret a small subset of the commandline directly:

\starttabulate[|l|p|]
\NC --lua=s      \NC load and execute a \LUA\ initialization script      \NC\NR
\NC --safer      \NC disable easily exploitable \LUA\ commands \NC\NR
\NC --help       \NC display help and exit                     \NC\NR
\NC --version    \NC display version and exit                  \NC\NR
\stoptabulate

Now it searches for the requested \LUA\ initialization script. If it
can not be found using the actual name given on the commandline, a
second attempt is made by prepending the value of the environment
variable \type{LUATEXDIR}, if that variable is defined.

Then it checks the \type{--safer} switch. You can use that to disable
some \LUA\ commands that can easily be abused by a malicious document. At
the moment, this switch \type{nil}s the following functions:

\starttabulate[|l|l|]
\NC \bf library \NC \bf functions                         \NC \NR
\NC \tt os      \NC \tt execute exec setenv rename remove tmpdir \NC \NR
\NC \tt io      \NC \tt popen output tmpfile              \NC \NR
\NC \tt lfs     \NC \tt rmdir mkdir chdir lock touch      \NC \NR
\stoptabulate

And it makes \lua{io.open()} fail on files that are opened for
anything besides reading.

Next the initialization script is loaded and executed. From within the
script, the entire commandline in available in the \LUA\ table
\lua{arg}, beginning with \lua {arg[0]}, containing the name of the executable.

Commandline processing happens very early on. So early, in fact, that
none of \TEX's initializations have taken place yet. For that reason,
the \luatex{tex}, \luatex{token}, \luatex{node} and \luatex{pdf}  tables 
are off|-|limits during the execution of the startup file (they are
nilled). Special care is taken that \luatex{texio.write} and
\luatex{texio.write_nl} function properly, so that you can at least
report your actions to the log file when (and if) it eventually
becomes opened (note that \TEX\ does not even know its \tex{jobname}
yet at this point). See \in{chapter}[libraries] for more information
about the \LUATEX-specific \LUA\ extension tables. 

The \LUA\ initialization script is loaded into \LUA\ state~0, and
everything you do will remain visible during the rest of the run, with
the exception of the aforementioned \luatex{tex}, \luatex{token},
\luatex{node} and \luatex{pdf} tables: those will be initialized 
to their documented state after the execution of the script. You
should not store anything in variables or within tables with these
four global names, as they will be overwritten completely.

We recommend you use the startup file only for your own
\TEX|-|independant initializations (if you need any), to parse the
commandline, set values in the \luatex{texconfig} table, and register
the callbacks you need. \LUATEX\ will fetch some of the other
commandline options from the \luatex{texconfig} table at the end of
script execution (see the description of the \luatex{texconfig} table
later on in this document for more details on which ones exactly).

Unless the \luatex{texconfig} table tells it not to start \KPATHSEA\
at all (set \luatex{texconfig.kpse_init} to \type{false} for that),
\LUATEX\ acts on three more commandline options after the
initialization script is finished:

\starttabulate[|l|l|]
\NC \bf flag         \NC \bf meaning                           \NC \NR
\NC \tt --fmt=s      \NC set the format name                   \NC \NR
\NC \tt --progname=s \NC set the progname (only for \KPATHSEA) \NC \NR
\NC \tt --ini        \NC enable \INITEX\ mode                  \NC \NR
\stoptabulate

In order to initialize the built|-|in \KPATHSEA\ library properly,
\LUATEX\ needs to know the correct \quote{progname} to use, and for that it
needs to check \type{-progname} (and \type{-ini} and \type{-fmt}, if
\type{-progname} is missing).

\section{\LUA\ changes}

The C coroutine (COCO) patches from luajit are applied to the Lua core, the used
version is 1.1.3.  See \hyphenatedurl{http://luajit.org/coco.html} for details.

The \lua{read("*line")} function from the io library has been
adjusted so that it is line|-|ending neutral: any of \type{LF}, \type
{CR} or \type{CR+LF} are acceptable line endings.

The \lua{tostring()} printer for numbers has been changed so that it
return~\type{0} instead of something like~\hbox{\type{2e-5}} (which confused \TEX\
enormously) when the value is so small that \TEX\ cannot distinguish
it from zero.

Dynamic loading of \type{.so} and \type{.dll} files is disabled on
all platforms.

\lua{luafilesystem} has been extended with two extra boolean functions
(\luatex{isdir(filename)} and \luatex{isfile(filename)}) and one extra
string field in its attributes table (\type{permissions}).

The \lua{string} library has an extra function:
\luatex{string.explode(s[,m])}. This function returns an array containing
the string argument \type{s} split into substrings based on the value
of the string argument \type{m}. The second argument is a string that
is either empty (this splits the string into characters), a single
character (this splits on each occurrence of that character, possibly
introducing empty strings), or a single character followed by the plus
sign \type{+} (this special version does not create empty
substrings). The default value for \type{m} is \quote{\type{ +}} (multiple
spaces).

Note: \type{m} is not hidden by surrounding braces (as it would be if
this function was written in \TEX\ macros).

The \lua{string} library also has six extra iterators that return strings
piecemeal:

\startitemize
\item \luatex{string.utfvalues(s)} (returns an integer value in the
\UNICODE\ range)
\item \luatex{string.utfcharacters(s)} (returns a string with a single
\UTF-8 token in it)
\item \luatex{string.characters(s)} (a string containing one byte)
\item \luatex{string.characterpairs(s)} (two strings each containing one byte) will
produce an empty second string in the string length was odd.
\item \luatex{string.bytes(s)} (a single byte value)
\item \luatex{string.bytepairs(s)} (two byte values) Will produce nil instead of a
number as its second return value if the string length was odd.
\stopitemize

The \luatex{string.characterpairs()} and \luatex{string.bytepairs()}
are useful especially in the conversion of UTF-16 encoded data into UTF-8.


Note: The \lua{string} library functions \luatex{find} etc. are not
Unicode-aware. In cases where this is required (i.e. because the
pattern used for searching contains characters above code point 127),
the corresponding functions from \lua{unicode.utf8} should be used.

\blank

The \lua{os} library has a few extra functions and variables:

\startitemize
\item \luatex{os.exec(commandline)} is a variation on \lua{os.execute}.

  The \type{commandline} can be either a single string or a single table. 

  If the argument is a table: \LUATEX\ first checks if there is a value at
  integer index zero. If there is, this is the command to be executed. Otherwise,
  it will use the value at integer index one. (if neither are present, nothing 
  at all happens).
  
  The set of consecutive values starting at integer 1 in the table are
  the arguments that are passed on to the command (the value at index 1 
  becomes \type{argv[0]}).  The command is searched for in the execution path, 
  so there is normally no need to pass on a fully qualified pathname.

  If the argument is a string, then it is automatically converted into 
  a table by splitting on whitespace. In this case, it is impossible
  for the command and first argument to differ from eachother.

  In the string argument format, whitespace can be protected by putting (part
  of) an argument inside single or double quotes.  One layer of quotes is
  interpreted by \LUATEX, and all occurences of \type{\"}, \type{\'} or
  \type{\\} within the quoted text are un-escaped.  In the table format, there
  is no string handling taking place.

  This function normally does not return control back to the lua script: the
  command will replace the current process. However, it will return \type{nil,
  'error'} if there was a problem while attempting to execute the command.

  On windows, the current process is actually kept in memory until after the
  execution of the command has finished. This prevents crashes in situations
  where \TEXLUA\ scripts are run inside integrated \TEX\ environments.


  (the original reason for this command is that it cleans out the current
  process before starting the new one, making it especially useful for
  use in \TEXLUA.)

\item \luatex{os.spawn(commandline)} is a returning version of \lua{os.exec},
  with otherwise identical calling conventions.
 
  If the command ran ok, then the return value is the exit status of the
  command. Otherwise, it will return \type{nil, 'error'}.

\item \luatex{os.setenv('key','value')}
  This sets a variable in the environment. Passing \lua{nil} instead of a
  value string will remove the variable.

\item \luatex{os.env}
  This is a hash table containing a dump of the variables and values
  in the process environment at the start of the run. It is writeable,
  but the actual environment is {\it not\/} updated automatically.

\item \luatex{os.gettimeofday()}
Returns the current `unix time', but as a float. This function is
not available on the SunOS platforms, so do not use this function
for portable documents.

\item \luatex{os.times()}
Returns the current process times cf. the unix C library `times'
call in seconds. This function is not available on the Windows and SunOS
platforms, so do not use this function for portable documents.

\item \luatex{os.tmpdir()} This will create a directory in the `current
directory' with the name \type{luatex.XXXXXX} where the X-es are
replaced by a unique string. The function also returns this string,
so you can \type{lfs.chdir()} into it, or \type{nil} if it failed to
create the directory.  The user is responsible for cleaning up at
the end of the run, it does not happen automatically. 

\item \luatex{os.type}
This is a string  that gives a global indication of the class of operating
system. The possible values are currently \type{windows}, \type{unix}, and
\type{msdos} (you are unlikely to find this value `in the wild'). 

\item \luatex{os.name}
This is a string that gives a more precise indication of the operating
system. These possible values are not yet fixed, and for \type{os.type} values
\type{windows} and \type{msdos}, the \type{os.name} values are simply 
\type{windows} and \type{msdos}

The list for the type \type{unix} is more precise: \type{linux}, 
\type{freebsd}, \type{openbsd}, \type{solaris}, \type{sunos} (pre-solaris), 
\type{hpux}, \type{irix}, \type{macosx}, \type{bsd} (unknown, but BSD-like), 
\type{sysv} (unknown, but SYSV-like), \type{generic} (unknown).

(\type{os.version} is planned as a future extension)

\stopitemize

In stock Lua, many things depend on the current locale. In \LUATEX, we can't do
that, because it makes documents unportable.  While \LUATEX\ is running if
forces the following locale settings:
\starttyping
	LC_CTYPE=C
	LC_COLLATE=C
	LC_NUMERIC=C
\stoptyping

\section {\LUA\ Modules}

Some modules that are normally external to Lua are statically linked
in with \LUATEX, because they offer useful functionality: 

\startitemize
\item \lua{slnunicode}, from the Selene libraries, \hyphenatedurl{http://luaforge.net/projects/sln}. (version 1.1)

This library has been slightly extended so that the \type{unicode.utf8.*} 
functions also accept the first 256 values of Plane~18. This is the range \LUATEX\ 
uses for raw binary output, as explained above,

\item \lua{luazip}, from the kepler project, \hyphenatedurl{http://www.keplerproject.org/luazip/}.  
  (version 1.2.1, but patched for compilation with lua 5.1)
\item \lua{luafilesystem}, also from the kepler project, \hyphenatedurl{http://www.keplerproject.org/luafilesystem/}.  
  (version 1.2, but patched for compilation with lua 5.1)
\item \lua{lpeg}, by Roberto Ierusalimschy, \hyphenatedurl{http://www.inf.puc-rio.br/~roberto/lpeg.html}. (version 0.7)

Note: \lua{lpeg} is not Unicode-aware, but interprets strings on a
byte-per-byte basis. This mainly means that \luatex{lpeg.S} cannot be
used with characters above code point 127, since those characters are
encoded using two bytes, and thus \luatex{lpeg.S} will look for one
of those two bytes when matching, not the combination of the two.

The same is true for \luatex{lpeg.R}, although the latter will display
an error message if used with characters above code point 127: I.e.
\luatex{lpeg.R('aä')} results in the message \type{bad argument #1 to
'R' (range must have two characters)}, since to \lua{lpeg}, \type{ä}
is two 'characters' (bytes), so \type{aä} totals three.

\item \lua{lzlib}, by Tiago Dionizio, \hyphenatedurl{http://mega.ist.utl.pt/~tngd/lua/}. (version 0.2)
\item \lua{md5}, by Roberto Ierusalimschy \hyphenatedurl{http://www.inf.puc-rio.br/~roberto/md5/md5-5/md5.html}.
\stopitemize

\chapter[libraries]{\LUATEX\ \LUA\ Libraries}

The interfacing between \TEX\ and \LUA\ is facilitated by a set of
library modules. The \LUA\ libraries in this chapter are all defined and 
initialized by the \LUATEX\ executable. Together, they allow \LUA\
scripts to query and change a number of \TEX's internal variables, run
various internal functions \TEX, and set up \LUATEX's hooks to execute
\LUA\ code.

\section{The \luatex{tex} library}

The \luatex{tex} table contains a large list of virtual internal \TEX\
parameters that are partially writable.

The designation \quote{virtual} means that these items are not properly
defined in \LUA, but are only front\-ends that are handled by a metatable
that operates on the actual \TEX\ values. As a result, most of the \LUA\
table operators (like \type{pairs} and \type{#}) do not work on such
items.

At the moment, it is possible to access almost every parameter
that has these characteristics:

\startitemize[packed]
\item You can use it after \tex{the}
\item It is a single token.
\stopitemize

This excludes parameters that need extra arguments, like
\tex{the}\tex{scriptfont}.

The subset comprising simple integer and dimension registers are
writable as well as readable (stuff like \tex{tracingcommands} and
\tex{parindent}).

\subsection{Integer parameters}

\stopcolumns

All \quote{convert} commands are read|-|only and return a \LUA\ string

If you are wondering why this list looks haphazard; these are all the
cases of the \quote{convert} internal command that do not require an
argument.

\subsection{attribute, count, dimension and token registers}

\TEX's attributes (\tex{attribute}), counters (\tex{count}),
dimensions (\tex{dimen}) and token (\tex{toks}) registers can be
accessed and written to using four virtual sub|-|tables of the
\luatex{tex} table:

\startcolumns[n=3]
\starttyping
tex.attribute
tex.count
tex.dimen
tex.toks
\stoptyping
\stopcolumns

It is possible to use the names of relevant \tex{attributedef}, \tex{countdef},
\tex{dimendef}, or \tex{toksdef} control sequences as indices
to these tables:

\starttyping
tex.count.scratchcounter = 0
enormous = tex.dimen['maxdimen']
\stoptyping

In this case, \LUATEX\ looks up the value for you on the fly. You have
to use a valid \tex{countdef} (or \tex{attributedef}, or
\tex{dimendef}, or \tex{toksdef}), anything else will generate an error
(the intent is to eventually also allow \type{<chardef tokens>} and even
macros that expand into a number)

The attribute and count registers accept and return \LUA\ numbers.

The dimension registers accept \LUA\ numbers (in scaled points) or
strings (with an included absolute dimension; \type {em} and \type {ex} and \type {px}
are forbidden). The result is always a number in scaled points.

The token registers accept and return \LUA\ strings. \LUA\ strings are
converted to and from token lists using \tex{the}\tex{toks} style
expansion: all category codes are either space (10) or other (12).

As an alternative to array addressing, there are also accessor
functions defined:

\startfunctioncall
tex.setdimen(number n, string s)
tex.setdimen(string s, string s)
tex.setdimen(number n, number n)
tex.setdimen(string s, number n)
number n = tex.getdimen(number n)
number n = tex.getdimen(string s)

tex.setcount(number n, number n)
tex.setcount(string s, number n)
number n = tex.getcount(number n)
number n = tex.getcount(string s)

tex.settoks (number n, string s)
tex.settoks (string s, string s)
string s = tex.gettoks (number n)
string s = tex.gettoks (string s)
\stopfunctioncall

\subsection{Box registers}

The current dimensions of \tex{box} registers can be read and
altered using three other virtual sub|-|tables :

\starttyping
tex.wd
tex.ht
tex.dp
\stoptyping

These are indexed strictly by number.

The box size registers accept \LUA\ numbers (in scaled points)
or strings (with included dimension). The result is always a number
in scaled points.

As an alternative to array addressing, there are also accessor
functions defined:

\startfunctioncall
tex.setboxwd(number n, number n)
number n = tex.getboxwd(number n)

tex.setboxht(number n, number n)
number n = tex.getboxht(number n)

tex.setboxdp(number n, number n)
number n = tex.getboxdp(number n)
\stopfunctioncall

It is also possible to set and query actual boxes, using the node
interface as defined in the \luatex{node} library:

\starttyping
tex.box
\stoptyping

for array access, or

\starttyping
tex.setbox(number n, <node> s)
<node> n = tex.getbox(number n)
\stoptyping

for function|-|based access

Be warned that an assignment like

\starttyping
tex.box[0] = tex.box[2]
\stoptyping

does not copy the node list, it just duplicates a node pointer.  If
\tex{box2} will be cleared by \TEX\ commands later on, the contents
of \tex{box0} becomes invalid as well. To prevent this from
happening, always use \luatex{node.copy_list()} unless you are
assigning to a temporary variable:

\starttyping
tex.box[0] = node.copy_list(tex.box[2])
\stoptyping

\subsection{Print functions}

The \luatex{tex} table also contains the three print functions that
are the major interface from \LUA\ scripting to \TEX.

The arguments to these three functions are all stored in an in|-|memory
virtual file that is fed to the \TEX\ scanner as the result of the
expansion of \tex{directlua}.

The total amount of returnable text from a \tex{directlua} command
is only limited by available system \RAM. However, each separate
printed string has to fit completely in \TEX's input buffer.

\subsubsection{\luatex{tex.print}}

\startfunctioncall
tex.print(string s, ...)
tex.print(number n, string s, ...)
\stopfunctioncall

Each string argument is treated by \TEX\ as a separate input line.

The optional parameter can be used to print the strings using the
catcode regime defined by \tex{catcodetable}~\type{n}. If \type{n} is not
a valid catcode table, then it is ignored, and the currently
active catcode regime is used instead.

The very last string of the very last \luatex{tex.print()} command in a
\tex{directlua} will not have the \tex{endlinechar} appended, all
others do.

\subsubsection{\luatex{tex.sprint}}

\startfunctioncall
tex.sprint(string s, ...)
tex.sprint(number n, string s, ...)
\stopfunctioncall

Each string argument is treated by \TEX\ as a special kind of input line
that makes it suitable for use as a partial line input mechanism:

\startitemize[packed]
\item \TEX\ does not switch to the \quote{new line} state, so
   that leading spaces are not ignored.
\item No \tex{endlinechar} is inserted.
\item Trailing spaces are not removed.
(Note that this does not prevent \TEX\ itself from eating spaces as
result of interpreting the line. For example, in 
\starttyping
before\directlua0{tex.sprint("\\relax")tex.sprint(" inbetween")}after
\stoptyping
the space before \type{inbetween} will be gobbled as a result of 
the \quote{normal} scanning of \type{\relax}).
\stopitemize


\subsubsection{\luatex{tex.write}}

\startfunctioncall
tex.write(string s, ...)
\stopfunctioncall

Each string argument is treated by \TEX\ as a special kind of input
line that makes is suitable for use as a quick way to dump
information:

\startitemize
\item All catcodes on that line are either \quote{space} (for '~') or
     \quote{character} (for all others).
\item There is no \tex{endlinechar} appended.
\stopitemize

\subsection{Helper functions}

\subsubsection{\luatex{tex.round}}

\startfunctioncall
number n =  tex.round(number o)
\stopfunctioncall

Rounds lua number \type{o}, and returns a number that is in the range
of a valid \TEX\ register value. If the number starts out of range, it
generates a \quote{Number to big} error as well.

\subsubsection{\luatex{tex.scale}}

\startfunctioncall
number n =  tex.scale(number o, number delta)
table n  =  tex.scale(table o, number delta)
\stopfunctioncall

Multiplies the lua numbers \type{o} and \type{delta}, and returns a
rounded number that is in the range of a valid \TEX\ register value.
In the table version, it creates a copy of the table with all numeric
top||level values scaled in that manner. If the mutiplied number(s) are
of range, it generates \quote{Number to big} error(s) as well.

\section{The \luatex{token} library}

The \luatex{token} table contains interface functions to \TEX's
handling of tokens. These functions are most useful when combined with
the \luatex{token_filter} callback, but they could be used standalone as
well.

A token is represented in \LUA\ as a small table. For the moment, this
table consists of three numeric entries:

\subsection{\luatex{token.get_next}}

\startfunctioncall
token t = token.get_next()
\stopfunctioncall

This fetches the next input token from the current input source,
without expansion.

\subsection{\luatex{token.is_expandable}}

\startfunctioncall
boolean b = token.is_expandable(token t)
\stopfunctioncall

This tests if the token \type{t} could be expanded.

\subsection{\luatex{token.expand}}

\startfunctioncall
token.expand()
\stopfunctioncall

If a token is expandable, this will expand one level of it, so that
the first token of the expansion will now be the next token to be read
by \luatex{tex.get_next()}.

\subsection{\luatex{token.is_activechar}}

\startfunctioncall
boolean b = token.is_activechar(token t)
\stopfunctioncall

This is a special test that is sometimes handy. Discovering whether
some token is the result of an active character turned out to be very
hard otherwise.

\subsection{\luatex{token.create}}

\startfunctioncall
token t = token.create(string csname)
token t = token.create(number charcode)
token t = token.create(number charcode, number catcode)
\stopfunctioncall

This is the token factory. If you feed it a string, then it is the
name of a control sequence (without leading backslash), and it will be
looked up in the equivalence table.

If you feed it number, then this is assumed to be an input character,
and an optional second number gives its category code.  This means it
is possible to overrule a character's category code, with a few
exceptions: the category codes~0 (escape), 9~(ignored), 13~(active),
14~(comment), and 15 (invalid) cannot occur inside a token. The values~0, 9, 14
and~15 are therefore illegal as input to \luatex{token.create()}, and
active characters will be resolved immediately.

Note: unknown string sequences and never defined active characters
will result in a token representing an \quote{undefined control sequence}
with a near|-|random name. It is {\it not\/} possible to define brand
new control sequences using \luatex{token.create}!

\subsection{\luatex{token.command_name}}

\startfunctioncall
string commandname = token.command_name(token t)
\stopfunctioncall

This returns the name associated with the \quote{command} value of the token
in \LUATEX. There is not always a direct connection between these names and
primitives. For instance, all \tex{ifxxx} tests are grouped under
\type {if_fest}, and the \quote{command modifier} defines which test is to be run.

\subsection{\luatex{token.command_id}}

\startfunctioncall
number i = token.command_idtring commandname)
\stopfunctioncall

This returns a number that is the inverse operation of the previous
command, to be used as the first item in a token table.

\subsection{\luatex{token.csname_name}}

\startfunctioncall
string csname = token.csname_name(token t)
\stopfunctioncall

This returns the name associated with the \quote{equivalence table} value of
the token in \LUATEX. It returns the string value of the command used
to create the current token, or an empty string if there is no
associated control sequence.

\subsection{\luatex{token.csname_id}}

\startfunctioncall
number i = token.csname_id(string csname)
\stopfunctioncall

This returns a number that is the inverse operation of the previous
command, to be used as the third item in a token table.

\section{The \luatex{node} library}

The \luatex{node} library contains functions that facilitate dealing
with (lists of) nodes and their values. They allow you to alter,
create, copy, delete, and insert \LUATEX\ node objects, the core
objects within the typesetter.

\LUATEX\ nodes are represented in \LUA\ as userdata with
the metadata type \luatex{luatex.node}. The various parts within
a node can be accessed using named fields.

Each node has at least the three fields \type{next}, \type{id}, and
\type{subtype}:

\startitemize[intro]

\item The \type{next} field returns the userdata
object for the next node in a linked list of nodes, or
nil, if there is no next node.

\item The \type{id} indicates \TEX's \quote{node type}. The field \type{id}
has a numeric value for efficiency reasons, but some of the library
functions also accept a string value instead of \type{id}.

\item The \type{subtype} is another number. It often gives further information
about a node of a particular \type{id}, but it is most important when dealing
with \quote{whatsits}, because they are differentiated solely based on their
\type{subtype}.
\stopitemize

The other available fields depend on the \type{id} (and for \quote{whatsits}, the
\type{subtype}) of the node. Further details on the various fields and their
meanings are given in~\in{chapter}[nodes].

\TEX's math nodes are not yet supported: there is not yet an interface
to the internals of the math list and it is not possible to create
them from \LUA. Support for \type{unset} (alignment) nodes is partial:
they can be queried and modified from \LUA\ code, but not created.

Nodes can be compared to each other, but: you are actually comparing
indices into the node memory. This means that equality tests can only
be trusted under very limited conditions. It will not work correctly
in any situation where one of the two nodes has been freed and|/|or
reallocated: in that case, there will be false positives.

At the moment, memory management of nodes should still be done
explicitly by the user.  Nodes are not \quote{seen} by the \LUA\
garbage collector, so you have to call the node free-ing functions
yourself when you are no longer in need of a node (list). Nodes form
linked lists without reference counting, so you have to be careful
that when control returns back to \LUATEX\ itself, you have not
deleted nodes that are still referenced from a \type{next} pointer
elsewhere, and that you did not create nodes that are referenced more
than once.

\subsection{Node handling functions}

\subsubsection{\luatex{node.types}}

\startfunctioncall
table t = node.types()
\stopfunctioncall

This function returns an array that maps node id numbers to node type
strings, providing an overview of the possible top|-|level \type{id}
types.

\subsubsection{\luatex{node.whatsits}}

\startfunctioncall
table t = node.whatsits()
\stopfunctioncall

\TEX's \quote{whatsits} all have the same \type{id}. The various subtypes
are defined by their \type{subtype}. The function is much like
\luatex{node.id}, except that it provides an array of \type{subtype}
mappings.

\subsubsection{\luatex{node.id}}

\startfunctioncall
number id = node.id(string type)
\stopfunctioncall

This converts a single type name to its internal numeric
representation.

\subsubsection{\luatex{node.subtype}}

\startfunctioncall
number subtype = node.subtype(string type)
\stopfunctioncall

This converts a single whatsit name to its internal numeric
representation (\type{subtype}).

\subsubsection{\luatex{node.type}}

\startfunctioncall
string type = node.type(number id)
\stopfunctioncall

This converts a internal numeric representation to an external string
representation.

\subsubsection{\luatex{node.fields}}

\startfunctioncall
table t = node.fields(number id)
table t = node.fields(number id, number subtype)
\stopfunctioncall

This function returns an array of valid field names for a particular
type of node. If you want to get the valid fields for a
\quote{whatsit}, you have to supply the second argument also. In other
cases, any given second argument will be silently ignored.

This function accepts string \type{id} and \type{subtype} values as
well.

\subsubsection{\luatex{node.has_field}}

\startfunctioncall
boolean t = node.has_field(<node> n, string field)
\stopfunctioncall

This function returns a boolean that is only true if \type{n} is
actually a node, and it has the field. 


\subsubsection{\luatex{node.new}}

\startfunctioncall
<node> n = node.new(number id)
<node> n = node.new(number id, number subtype)
\stopfunctioncall

Creates a new node. All of the new node's fields are initialized to
either zero or nil except for \type{id} and \type{subtype} (if
supplied). If you want to create a new whatsit, then the second
argument is required, otherwise it need not be present. As with all
node functions, this function creates an node on the \TEX\ level.

This function accepts string \type{id} and \type{subtype} values as
well.

\subsubsection{\luatex{node.free}}

\startfunctioncall
node.free(<node> n)
\stopfunctioncall

Removes the node \type{n} from \TEX's memory. Be careful: no checks
are done on whether this node is still pointed to from a register or some
\type{next} field: it is up to you to make sure that the internal data
structures remain correct.

\subsubsection{\luatex{node.flush_list}}

\startfunctioncall
node.flush_list(<node> n)
\stopfunctioncall

Removes the node list \type{n} and the complete node list following
\type{n} from \TEX's memory. Be careful: no checks are done on whether
any of these nodes is still pointed to from a register or some
\type{next} field: it is up to you to make sure that the internal data
structures remain correct.

\subsubsection{\luatex{node.copy}}

\startfunctioncall
<node> m = node.copy(<node> n)
\stopfunctioncall

Creates a deep copy of node \type{n}, including all nested lists as in
the case of a hlist or vlist node. Only the \type{next} field is not
copied.

\subsubsection{\luatex{node.copy_list}}

\startfunctioncall
<node> m = node.copy_list(<node> n)
\stopfunctioncall

Creates a deep copy of the node list that starts at \type{n}.

\subsubsection{\luatex{node.hpack}}

\startfunctioncall
<node> h = node.hpack(<node> n)
<node> h = node.hpack(<node> n, number w, string info)
\stopfunctioncall

This function creates a new hlist by packaging the list that begins at  node
\type{n} into a horizontal box. With only a single argument, this box 
is created using the natural width of its components. In the three
argument form, \type{info} must be either \type{additional} or
\type{exactly}, and \type{w} is the additional (\type{\hbox spread})
or exact (\type{\hbox to}) width to be used.

Caveat: at this moment, there can be unexpected side|-|effects to this
function, like updating some of the \type{\marks} and \type{\inserts}.

\subsubsection{\luatex{node.slide}}

\startfunctioncall
<node> m = node.slide(<node> n)
\stopfunctioncall

Returns the last node of the node list that starts at \type{n}. As a
side|-|effect, it also creates a reverse chain of \type{prev} pointers
between nodes.

\subsubsection{\luatex{node.length}}

\startfunctioncall
number i = node.length(<node> n)
number i = node.length(<node> n, <node> m)
\stopfunctioncall

Returns the number of nodes contained in the node list that starts at
\type{n}. If \type{m} is also supplied it stops at \type{m} instead of
at the end of the list. The node \type{m} is not counted.

\subsubsection{\luatex{node.count}}

\startfunctioncall
number i = node.count(number id, <node> n)
number i = node.count(number id, <node> n, <node> m)
\stopfunctioncall

Returns the number of nodes contained in the node list that starts at
\type{n} that have an matching \type{id} field.
If \type{m} is also supplied, counting stops at \type{m} instead of at
the end of the list. The node \type{m} is not counted.

This function also accept string \type{id}'s.

\subsubsection{\luatex{node.traverse}}

\startfunctioncall
<node> t = node.traverse(<node> n)
\stopfunctioncall

This is an iterator that loops over the node list that starts at \type{n}.

\subsubsection{\luatex{node.traverse_id}}

\startfunctioncall
<node> t = node.traverse_id(number id, <node> n)
\stopfunctioncall

This is an iterator that loops over all the nodes in the list that
starts at \type{n} that have a matching \type{id} field. 

\subsubsection{\luatex{node.remove}}

\startfunctioncall
<node> head, current = node.remove(<node> head, <node> current)
\stopfunctioncall

This function removes the node \type{current} from the list following
\type{head}. It is your responsibility to make sure it is really part
of that list. The return values are the new \type{head} and
\type{current} nodes. The returned \type{current} is the 
node in the calling argument, and is only passed back as a convenience
(its \type{next} field will be cleared). The returned \type{head} is
more important, because if the function is called with \type{current}
equal to \type{head}, it will be changed.


\subsubsection{\luatex{node.insert_before}}

\startfunctioncall
<node> head, new = node.insert_before(<node> head, <node> current, <node> new)
\stopfunctioncall

This function inserts the node \type{new} before \type{current} into
the list following \type{head}. It is your responsibility to make sure
that \type{current} is really part of that list. The return values are
the (potentially mutated) \type{head} and the \type{new}, set up to
be part of the list (with correct \type{next} field). If \type{head}
is initially \type{nil}, it will become \type{new}.


\subsubsection{\luatex{node.insert_after}}

\startfunctioncall
<node> head, new = node.insert_after(<node> head, <node> current, <node> new)
\stopfunctioncall

This function inserts the node \type{new} after \type{current} into
the list following \type{head}. It is your responsibility to make sure
that \type{current} is really part of that list. The return values are
the \type{head} and the \type{new}, set up to be part of the list
(with correct \type{next} field). If \type{head} is initially
\type{nil}, it will become \type{new}.

\subsubsection{\luatex{node.first_character}}

\startfunctioncall
<node> n = node.first_character(<node> n)
<node> n = node.first_character(<node> n, <node> m)
\stopfunctioncall

Returns the first node that is a glyph node with a subtype indicating
it is a character, or \type{nil}. 

\subsubsection{\luatex{node.ligaturing}}

\startfunctioncall
<node> h, <node> t, <boolean> success = node.ligaturing(<node> n)
<node> h, <node> t, <boolean> success = node.ligaturing(<node> n, <node> m)
\stopfunctioncall

Apply \TEX-style ligaturing to the specified nodelist. The tail node
\type{m} is optional. The two returned nodes \type{h} and \type{t} are
the new head and tail (both \type{n} and \type{m} can change into 
a new ligature).

\subsubsection{\luatex{node.kerning}}

\startfunctioncall
<node> h, <node> t, <boolean> success = node.kerning(<node> n)
<node> h, <node> t, <boolean> success = node.kerning(<node> n, <node> m)
\stopfunctioncall

Apply \TEX-style kerning to the specified nodelist. The tail node
\type{m} is optional. The two returned nodes \type{h} and \type{t} are
the head and tail (either one of these can be an inserted kern node,
because special kernings with word boundaries are possible).




\subsubsection{\luatex{node.unprotect_glyphs}}

\startfunctioncall
node.unprotect_glyphs(<node> n)
\stopfunctioncall

Substracts 256 from all glyph node subtypes. This and the next
function are helpers to convert from \type{characters} to
\type{glyphs} during node processing.


\subsubsection{\luatex{node.protect_glyphs}}

\startfunctioncall
node.protect_glyphs(<node> n)
\stopfunctioncall

Adds 256 to all glyph node subtypes in the node list starting at
\type{n}, except that if the value is 1, it adds only 255. The special
handling of 1 means that \type{characters} will become \type{glyphs}
after substraction of 256.

\subsubsection{\luatex{node.last_node}}

\startfunctioncall
<node> n = node.last_node()
\stopfunctioncall

This function pops the last node from \TEX's `current list'. 
It returns that node, or \type{nil} if the current list is empty.

\subsubsection{\luatex{node.write}}

\startfunctioncall
node.write(<node> n)
\stopfunctioncall

This is an experimental function that will append a node list to 
\TEX's `current list'. There is no error checking yet!



\subsection{Attribute handling}

Attributes appear as linked list of userdata objects in the
\type{attr} field of individual nodes. They can be handled
individually, but it much safer and more efficient to use the
dedicated functions associated with them.

\subsubsection{\luatex{node.has_attribute}}

\startfunctioncall
number v = node.has_attribute(<node> n, number id)
number v = node.has_attribute(<node> n, number id, number val)
\stopfunctioncall

Tests if a node has the attribute with number \type{id} set. If
\type{val} is also supplied, also tests if the value matches \type{val}.
It returns the value, or, if no match is found, nil.

\subsubsection{\luatex{node.set_attribute}}

\startfunctioncall
node.set_attribute(<node> n, number id, number val)
\stopfunctioncall

Sets the attribute with number \type{id} to the value
\type{val}. Duplicate assignments are ignored.

\subsubsection{\luatex{node.unset_attribute}}

\startfunctioncall
number v = node.unset_attribute(<node> n, number id, number val)
number v = node.unset_attribute(<node> n, number id)
\stopfunctioncall

Unsets the attribute with number \type{id}. If \type{val} is also supplied,
it will only perform this operation if the value matches \type{val}.
Missing attributes or attribute|-|value pairs are ignored.

If the attribute was actually deleted, returns its old
value. Otherwise, returns nil.

\section{The \luatex{texio} library}

This library takes care of the low|-|level I/O interface.

\subsection{Printing functions}

\subsubsection{\luatex{texio.write}}

\startfunctioncall
texio.write(string target, string s, ...)
texio.write(string s, ...)
\stopfunctioncall

Without the \type{target} argument, writes all given strings to the same
location(s) \TEX\ writes messages to at this moment. If
\tex{batchmode} is in effect, it writes only to the log,
otherwise  it writes to the log and the terminal.

The optional \type{target} can be one of three possibilities:
\type{term}, \type{log} or \type {term and log}.

Note: If several strings are given, and if the first of these strings
is or might be one of the targets above, the \type{target} must be
specified explicitely to prevent \LUA\ from interpreting the first
string as the target.

\subsubsection{\luatex{texio.write_nl}}

\startfunctioncall
texio.write_nl(string target, string s, ...)
texio.write_nl(string s, ...)
\stopfunctioncall

Like \luatex{texio.write}, but make sure that the given strings will
appear at the beginning of a line. You can pass a single empty string
if you only want to move to the next line.

\section{The \luatex{pdf} library}

This table contains the current \type{h} en \type{v} values that
define the location on the output page. The values can be queried
and set using scaled points as units.

\starttyping
pdf.v
pdf.h
\stoptyping

The associated function calls are

\startfunctioncall
pdf.setv(number n)
number n = pdf.getv()
pdf.seth(number n)
number n = pdf.geth()
\stopfunctioncall


It also holds a print function to write stuff to the \PDF\ document,
that can be used from within a \tex{latelua} argument. This function
is not to be used inside \tex{directlua} unless you know {\it
exactly} what you are doing.

\subsubsubject{\luatex{pdf.print}}

\startfunctioncall
pdf.print(string s)
pdf.print(string type, string s)
\stopfunctioncall

The optional parameter can be used to mimic the behaviour of
\tex{pdfliteral}: the \type{type} is \type{direct} or \type{page}.

\section{The \luatex{img} library}

The \type{img} library can be used as an alternative to
\tex{pdfximage} and \tex{pdfrefximage}, and the associated `satellite'
commands like \tex{pdfximagebbox}.

\subsubsubject{\luatex{img.new}}

\startfunctioncall
<image> var = img.new()
<image> var = img.new(image_spec) 
\stopfunctioncall

This function creates a userdata opject with the right type. The 
\type{image_spec} argument is a optional. If it is given, it must be
a table, and that table must have a \type{filename} key.  A number of
other keys can also be useful, these are enumerated explained below.

You can either say
\starttyping
a=img.new()
\stoptyping 
followed by 
\starttyping
a.filename="foo.png"
\stoptyping 
or you can put the file name (and some or all of the other keys)
into a table directly, like so:
\starttyping
a=img.new{filename='foo.pdf',page=1}
\stoptyping

The generated \type{<image>} userdata object allows access to a set of
user-specified values as well as a set of values that are normally
filled in and updated automatically by \LUATEX\ itself. Some of those
are derived from the actual image file, other are updated to reflect 
tyhe PDF output status of the object.

There is one required user-specified field: the file name
(\type{filename}).  It can optionally be augmented by the requested
image dimensions (\type{width}, \type{depth}, \type{height}),
user-specified image attributes (\type{attr}), the requested PDF page
identifier (\type{page}), the requested boundingbox (\type{pagebox})
for PDF inclusion, the requested color space (\type{colorspace}).

The function \type{img.new} does not access the actual image file, it
just creates the \type{<image>} userdata object and initializes some
memory structures. The \type{<image>} object and it's internal
structures are automatically garbage collected.

Once the image is written to the PDF, all the values in the 
\type{<image>} become frozen, and you cannot change them any more.

\subsubsubject{\luatex{img.keys}}

\startfunctioncall
<table> keys = img.keys()
\stopfunctioncall

This function returns a list of all the possible \type{image_spec}
keys, both user-supplied and automatic ones. 

\starttabulate[|l|l|p|]

\NC yres          \NC number   \NC Vertical natural image resolution (dpi) \NC \NR
\stoptabulate

A running (undefined) dimension in \type{width}, \type{height}, or \type{depth} is
represented as \type{nil} in Lua, so if you want to load an image at
it's `natural' size, you do not have to specify any of those three fields.

\subsubsubject{\luatex{img.scan}}

\startfunctioncall
<image> var = img.scan(<image> var) 
<image> var = img.scan(image_spec)
\stopfunctioncall

When you say \type{img.scan(a)}, the file is scanned, and variables
such as \type{xsize}, \type{ysize}, image \type{type}, number of
\type{pages}, and the resolution are extracted. Each of the \type{width},
\type{height}, \type{depth} fields are set up if they were not
given an explicit value already.

For ease of use, you can do right-away a 
\starttyping
a=img.scan{filename="foo.png"} 
\stoptyping
without a prior \type{img.new}.

Nothing is written yet at this point, so you can do \type{a=img.scan},
retrieve the available info like image width and height, and then
throw away \type{a} again by saying \type{a=nil}.  In that case, no
image object will be reserved in the PDF, and the used memory will be
cleaned up automatically.


\subsubsubject{\luatex{img.copy}}

\startfunctioncall
<image> var = img.copy(<image> var) 
<image> var = img.copy(image_spec)
\stopfunctioncall

If you say \type{a = b}, then both variables point to the same
\type{<image>} object. if you want to write out an image with
different sizes, you can do a \type{b=img.copy(a)}. 

Afterwards, \type{a} and \type{b} still reference the same actual
image dictionary, but the dimensions for \type{b} can now be changed
from their initial values that were just copies from \type{a}.

% Hartmut, I don't know if this makes sense. An example of what
% can, and what cannot be changed would be helpful.

\subsubsubject{\luatex{img.write}}

\startfunctioncall
<image> var = img.write(<image> var) 
<image> var = img.write(image_spec)
\stopfunctioncall

The image is written out by \type{img.write(a)}. 

Again you can do a terse call like
\starttyping
img.write{filename="foo.png"}
\stoptyping

The \type{<image>} variable is returned in case you want it for later
processing.


\section{The \luatex{callback} library}

This library has functions that register, find and list callbacks.

The \luatex{callback} library is only available in \LUA\ state zero (0).

\startfunctioncall
id, error = callback.register(string callback_name,function callback_func)
id, error = callback.register(string callback_name,nil)
\stopfunctioncall

where the \syntax{callback_name} is a predefined callback name, see
below. The function returns the internal \type{id} of the callback
or \type{nil}, if the callback could not be registered. In the latter
case, \type{error} contains an error message, otherwise it is
\type{nil}.

\LUATEX\ internalizes the callback function in such a way that
it does not matter if you redefine a function accidentally.

Callback assignments are always global. You can use the special value
\type {nil} instead of a function for clearing the callback.

Currently, callbacks are not dumped in the format file.

\startfunctioncall
table info = callback.list()
\stopfunctioncall

The keys in the table are the known callback names, the value is a
boolean where \type{true} means that the callback is currently set
(active).

\startfunctioncall
function f = callback.find(callback_name)
\stopfunctioncall

If the callback is not set, \luatex{callback.find} returns \type{nil}.

\subsection{File discovery callbacks}

\subsubsection{\luatex{find_read_file} and \luatex{find_write_file}}

You callback function should have the following conventions:

\startfunctioncall
string actual_name = function (number id_number, string asked_name)
\stopfunctioncall

Arguments:

\startitemize

\sym{id_number} 

This number is zero for the log or \tex {input} files. For \TEX's \tex{read} or
\tex{write} the number is incremented by one, so \tex{read0} becomes~1.

\sym{asked_name} 

This is the user|-|supplied filename, as found by \tex{input}, \tex{openin}
or \tex{openout}.

\stopitemize

Return value:

\startitemize

\sym{actual_name} 

This is the filename used. For the very first file that is read in by
\TEX, you have to make sure you return an \type{actual_name} that has
an extension and that is suitable for use as \type{jobname}. If you
don't, you will have to manually fix the name of the log file and
output file after \LUATEX\ is finished, and an eventual format
filename will become mangled. That is because these file names depend
on the jobname.

You have to return \type{nil} if the file cannot be found.

\stopitemize

\subsubsection{\luatex{find_font_file}}

Your callback function should have the following conventions:

\startfunctioncall
string actual_name = function (string asked_name)
\stopfunctioncall

The \type{asked_name} is an \OTF\ or \TFM\ font metrics file.

Return \type{nil} if the file cannot be found.

\subsubsection{\luatex{find_output_file}}

You callback function should have the following conventions:

\startfunctioncall
string actual_name = function (string asked_name)
\stopfunctioncall

The \type{asked_name} is the \PDF\ or \DVI\ file for writing.

\subsubsection{\luatex{find_format_file}}

You callback function should have the following conventions:

\startfunctioncall
string actual_name = function (string asked_name)
\stopfunctioncall

The \type{asked_name} is a format file for reading (the format file
for writing is always opened in the current directory).

\subsubsection{\luatex{find_vf_file}}

Like \luatex{find_font_file}, but for virtual fonts. This applies to
both \ALEPH's \OVF\ files and traditional Knuthian \VF\ files.

\subsubsection{\luatex{find_ocp_file}}

Like \luatex{find_font_file}, but for ocp files.

\subsubsection{\luatex{find_map_file}}

Like \luatex{find_font_file}, but for map files.

\subsubsection{\luatex{find_enc_file}}

Like \luatex{find_font_file}, but for enc files.

\subsubsection{\luatex{find_sfd_file}}

Like \luatex{find_font_file}, but for subfont definition files.

\subsubsection{\luatex{find_pk_file}}

Like \luatex{find_font_file}, but for pk bitmap files. The argument
\type{name} is a bit special in this case. Its form is

\starttyping
<base res>dpi/<fontname>.<actual res>pk
\stoptyping

So you may be asked for \type{600dpi/manfnt.720pk}.  It is up to you
to find a \quote{reasonable} bitmap file to go with that specification.

\subsubsection{\luatex{find_data_file}}

Like \luatex{find_font_file}, but for embedded files (\tex{pdfobj file '...'}).

\subsubsection{\luatex{find_opentype_file}}

Like \luatex{find_font_file}, but for \OPENTYPE\ font files.

\subsubsection{\luatex{find_truetype_file} and \luatex{find_type1_file}}

Your callback function should have the following conventions:

\startfunctioncall
string actual_name = function (string asked_name)
\stopfunctioncall

The \type{asked_name} is a font file. This callback is called while
\LUATEX\ is building its internal list of needed font files, so the
actual timing may surprise you. Your return value is later fed back
into the matching \luatex{read_file} callback.

Strangely enough, \luatex{find_type1_file} is also used for \OPENTYPE\
(\OTF) fonts.

\subsubsection{\luatex{find_image_file}}

You callback function should have the following conventions:

\startfunctioncall
string actual_name = function (string asked_name)
\stopfunctioncall

The \type{asked_name} is an image file. Your return value is used to
open a file from the harddisk, so make sure you return something that
is considered the name of a valid file by your operating system.

\subsection[iocallback]{File reading callbacks}

\subsubsection{\luatex{open_read_file}}

You callback function should have the following conventions:

\startfunctioncall
table env = function (string file_name)
\stopfunctioncall

Argument:

\startitemize

\sym{file_name} 

the filename returned by a previous \luatex{find_read_file} or the return
value of \luatex{kpse.find_file()} if there was no such callback defined.

\stopitemize

Return value:

\startitemize

\sym{env} 

this is a table containing at least one required and one optional
callback functions for this file. The required field is
\luatex{reader} and the associated function will be called once
for each new line to be read, the optional one is \luatex{close}
that will be called once when \LUATEX\ is done with the file.

\LUATEX\ never looks at the rest of the table, so you can use it to
store your private per|-|file data. Both the callback functions will
receive the table as their only argument.

\stopitemize

\subsubsubsection{\luatex{reader}}

\LUATEX\ will run this function whenever it needs a new input line
from the file.

\startfunctioncall
function(table env)
    return string line
end
\stopfunctioncall

Your function should return either a string or \type{nil}. The value \type{nil}
signals that the end of file has occurred, and will make \TEX\ call
the optional \luatex{close} function next.

\subsubsubsection{\luatex{close}}

\LUATEX\ will run this optional function when it decides to close the file.

\startfunctioncall
function(table env)
    return
end
\stopfunctioncall

Your function should not return any value.

\subsubsection{General file readers}

There is a set of callbacks for the loading of binary data
files. These all use the same interface:

\startfunctioncall
function(string name)
    return boolean success, string data, number data_size
end
\stopfunctioncall

The \type{name} will normally be a full path name as it is returned by
either one of the file discovery callbacks or the internal version of
\luatex{kpse.find_file()}.

\startitemize

\sym{success} 

return false when a fatal error occured (e.g. when the file cannot be
found, after all).

\sym{data} 

the bytes comprising the file.

\sym{data_size} 

the length of the \type{data}, in bytes.

\stopitemize

return an empty string and zero if the file was found but there was a
reading problem.

The list of functions is:
\starttabulate[|l|p|]
\NC \luatex{read_font_file} \NC This function is called when \TEX\ needs to read a \type{ofm} or
                                \type{tfm} file. \NC\NR
\NC \luatex{read_vf_file}       \NC for virtual fonts.\NC\NR
\NC \luatex{read_ocp_file}      \NC for ocp files.\NC\NR
\NC \luatex{read_map_file}      \NC for map files.\NC\NR
\NC \luatex{read_enc_file}      \NC for encoding files.\NC\NR
\NC \luatex{read_sfd_file}      \NC for subfont definition files.\NC\NR
\NC \luatex{read_pk_file}       \NC for pk bitmap files. \NC\NR
\NC \luatex{read_data_file}     \NC for embedded files (\tex{pdfobj file '...'}).\NC\NR
\NC \luatex{read_truetype_file} \NC for \TRUETYPE\ font files. \NC\NR
\NC \luatex{read_type1_file}    \NC for \TYPEONE\ font files.\NC\NR
\NC \luatex{read_opentype_file} \NC for \OPENTYPE\ font files.  \NC\NR
\stoptabulate

\subsection{Data processing callbacks}

\subsubsection{\luatex{process_input_buffer}}


This callback allows you to change the contents of the line input
buffer just before \LUATEX\ actually starts looking at it.

\startfunctioncall
function(string buffer)
    return string adjusted_buffer
end
\stopfunctioncall

If you return \type{nil}, \LUATEX\ will pretend like your callback
never happened. You can gain a small amount of processing time from
that.


\subsubsection{\luatex{token_filter}}

This callback allows you to replace the way \LUATEX\ fetches
lexical tokens.

\startfunctioncall
function()
    return table token
end
\stopfunctioncall

The calling convention for this callback is bit more complicated than
for most other callbacks.  The function should either return a \LUA\
table representing a valid to|-|be|-|processed token or tokenlist, or
something else like nil or an empty table.

If your \LUA\ function does not return a table representing a valid
token, it will be immediately called again, until it eventually does
return a useful token or tokenlist (or until you reset the callback
value to nil). See the description of \luatex{token} for some
handy functions to be used in conjunction with this callback.

If your function returns a single usable token, then that token will
be processed by \LUATEX\ immediately. If the function returns a token
list (a table consisting of a list of consecutive token tables), then
that list will be pushed to the input stack as completely new token
list level, with its token type set to \quote{inserted}. In either case,
the returned token(s) will not be fed back into the callback function.

\subsection{Node list processing callbacks}

The description of nodes and node lists is in~\in{chapter}[nodes].

\subsubsection{\luatex{buildpage_filter}}

This callback is called whenever \LUATEX\ is ready to move stuff to
the main vertical list. You can use this callback to do specialized
manipulation of the page building stage like imposition or column
balancing.

\startfunctioncall
function(<node> head, string extrainfo)
    return true | false | <node> newhead
end
\stopfunctioncall

As for all the callbacks that deal with nodes, the return value can be
one of three things:

\startitemize[packed]
\item \type{boolean true} signals succesful processing
\item \type{node} signals that the \quote{head} node should be
replaced by this node
\item \type{boolean false} signals that the \quote{head} node list should be
ignored and flushed from memory
\stopitemize

The string \type{extrainfo} gives some additional information about
what \TEX's state is with respect to the \quote{current page}. The possible
values are:

\starttabulate[|lT|p|]
\NC \bf value           \NC \bf explanation                        \NC\NR
\NC \tt alignment       \NC a (partial) alignment is being added   \NC\NR
\NC \tt box             \NC a typeset box is being added           \NC\NR
\NC \tt begin_of_par    \NC the beginning of a new paragraph       \NC\NR
\NC \tt vmode_par       \NC \tex{par} was found in vertical mode   \NC\NR
\NC \tt hmode_par       \NC \tex{par} was found in horizontal mode \NC\NR
\NC \tt insert          \NC an insert is added                     \NC\NR
\NC \tt penalty         \NC a penalty (in vertical mode)           \NC\NR
\NC \tt before_display  \NC immediately before a display starts    \NC\NR
\NC \tt after_display   \NC a display is finished                  \NC\NR
\stoptabulate

\subsubsection{\luatex{pre_linebreak_filter}}

This callback is called just before \LUATEX\ starts converting a list
of nodes into a stack of \tex{hbox}es. The removal of a possible final skip
and the subsequent insertion of \tex{parfillskip} has not happened
yet at that moment.

\startfunctioncall
function(<node> head, string groupcode)
    return true | false | <node> newhead
end
\stopfunctioncall

The string called \type {groupcode} identifies the nodelist's context
within \TEX's processing. The range of possibilities is given in the
table below, but not all of those can actually appear in
\luatex {pre_linebreak_filter}, some are for the
\luatex {hpack_filter} and \luatex {vpack_filter} callbacks that 
will be explained in the next two paragraphs.

\starttabulate[|lT|p|]
\NC \bf value        \NC \bf explanation                           \NC\NR
\NC \tt hbox         \NC \tex{hbox} in horizontal mode             \NC\NR
\NC \tt adjusted_hbox\NC \tex{hbox} in vertical mode               \NC\NR
\NC \tt vbox         \NC \tex{vbox}                                \NC\NR
\NC \tt vtop         \NC \tex{vtop}                                \NC\NR
\NC \tt align        \NC \tex{halign} or \tex{valign}              \NC\NR
\NC \tt disc         \NC discretionaries                           \NC\NR
\NC \tt insert       \NC packaging an insert                       \NC\NR
\NC \tt vcenter      \NC \tex{vcenter}                             \NC\NR
\NC \tt local_box    \NC \tex{localleftbox} or \tex{localrightbox} \NC\NR
\NC \tt split_off    \NC top of a \tex{vsplit}                     \NC\NR
\NC \tt split_keep   \NC remainder of a \tex{vsplit}               \NC\NR
\NC \tt align_set    \NC alignment cell                            \NC\NR
\NC \tt fin_row      \NC alignment row                             \NC\NR
\stoptabulate

\subsubsection{\luatex{post_linebreak_filter}}

This callback is called just after \LUATEX\ has converted a list
of nodes into a stack of \tex{hbox}es. 

\startfunctioncall
function(<node> head, string groupcode)
    return true | false | <node> newhead
end
\stopfunctioncall

\subsubsection{\luatex{hpack_filter}}

This callback is called when \TEX\ is ready to start boxing some
horizontal mode material. Math items are ignored at the moment.

\startfunctioncall
function(<node> head, string groupcode, number size, string packtype)
    return true | false | <node> newhead
end
\stopfunctioncall

The \type{packtype} is either \type{additional} or \type{exactly}. If
\type{additional}, then the \type{size} is a \tex{hbox spread ...}
argument. If \type{exactly}, then the \type{size} is a \tex{hbox to ...}.
In both cases, the number is in scaled points.

\subsubsection{\luatex{vpack_filter}}

This callback is called when \TEX\ is ready to start boxing some
vertical mode material. Math displays are ignored at the moment.

This function is very similar to the \luatex{hpack_filter}. Besides
the fact that it is called at different moments, there is an extra
variable that matches \TEX's \tex{maxdepth} setting.

\startfunctioncall
function(<node> head, string groupcode, number size, string packtype,  number maxdepth)
    return true | false | <node> newhead
end
\stopfunctioncall

\subsubsection{\luatex{pre_output_filter}}

This callback is called when \TEX\ is ready to start boxing the
box 255 for \tex{output}.

\startfunctioncall
function(<node> head, string groupcode, number size, string packtype, number maxdepth)
    return true | false | <node> newhead
end
\stopfunctioncall

\subsubsection{\luatex{hyphenate}}

\startfunctioncall
function(<node> head, <node> tail)
end
\stopfunctioncall

No return values. This callback has to insert discretionary nodes in
the node list it receives.


\subsubsection{\luatex{ligaturing}}

\startfunctioncall
function(<node> head, <node> tail)
end
\stopfunctioncall

No return values. This callback has to apply ligaturing to the node
list it receives.

You don't have to worry about return values because the \type{head}
node that is passed on to the callback is guaranteed not to be a
glyph_node (if need be, a temporary node will be prepended), and
therefore it cannot be affected by the mutations that take place.  
After the callback, the internal value of the `tail of the list' 
will be recalculated. 

The \type{next} of \type{head} is guaranteed to be non-nil.

The \type{next} of \type{tail} is guaranteed be nil, and therefore the
second callback argument can often be ignored. It is provided for
orthogonality, and because it can sometimes be handy when special
processing has to take place.

\subsubsection{\luatex{kerning}}

\startfunctioncall
function(<node> head, <node> tail) end
\stopfunctioncall

No return values. This callback has to apply kerning between the nodes
in the node list it receives. See \type{ligaturing} for calling
conventions.


\subsection{Information reporting callbacks}

\subsubsection{\luatex{start_run}}

\startfunctioncall
function()
\stopfunctioncall

Replaces the code that prints \LUATEX's banner

\subsubsection{\luatex{stop_run}}

\startfunctioncall
function()
\stopfunctioncall

Replaces the code that prints \LUATEX's statistics and \quote{output written
to} messages.

\subsubsection{\luatex{start_page_number}}

\startfunctioncall
function()
\stopfunctioncall

Replaces the code that prints the \type{[} and the page number at the
begin of \tex{shipout}. This callback will also override the
printing of box information that normally takes place when
\tex{tracingoutput} is positive.

\subsubsection{\luatex{stop_page_number}}

\startfunctioncall
function()
\stopfunctioncall

Replaces the code that prints the \type{]} at the end of \tex{shipout}

\subsubsection{\luatex{show_error_hook}}

\startfunctioncall
function()
    return
end
\stopfunctioncall

This callback is run from inside the \TEX\ error function, and the idea
is to allow you to do some extra reporting on top of what \TEX\ already
does (none of the normal actions are removed). You may find some of
the values in the \luatex{status} table useful.

\startitemize

\sym{message} 

is the formal error message \TEX\ has given to the user
(the line after the '!')

\sym{indicator} 

is either a filename (when it is a string) or a location indicator (a
number) that can means lots of different things like a token list id
or a \tex{read} number.

\sym{lineno} 

is the current line number
\stopitemize

This is an investigative item for 'testing the water' only.
The final goal is the total replacement of \TEX's error handling
routines, but that needs lots of adjustments in the web source because
\TEX\ deals with errors in a somewhat haphazard fashion. This is why the
exact definition of \type{indicator} is not given here.

\subsection{Font-related callbacks}

\subsubsection{\luatex{define_font}}

\startfunctioncall
function(string name, number size, number id) return table font end
\stopfunctioncall

The string \type{name} is the filename part of the font
specification, as given by the user.

The number \type{size} is a bit special:

\startitemize[packed]
\item if it is positive, it specifies an \quote{at size} in scaled points.
\item if it is negative, its absolute value represents a \quote{scaled}
setting relative to the designsize of the font.
\stopitemize

The internal structure of the \type{font} table that is to be
returned is explained in \in{chapter}[fonts]. That table is saved
internally, so you can put extra fields in the table for your
later \LUA\ code to use.

\section{The \luatex{lua} library}

This library contains two read|-|only  items:

\subsection{Variables}

\starttyping
number n = lua.id
\stoptyping

This returns the id number of the instance.

\starttyping
string s = lua.version
\stoptyping

This returns a \LUATEX\ version identifier string. The value is
currently \directlua0{tex.print('lua.version')}, but it is soon to be
replaced by something more elaborate.

\subsection{\LUA\ bytecode registers}

\LUA\ registers can be used to communicate \LUA\ functions across \LUA\
states. The accepted values for assignments are functions and
nil. Likewise, the retrieved value is either a function or \type{nil}.

\starttyping
lua.bytecode[n] = function () .. end
lua.bytecode[n]()
\stoptyping

The contents of the \luatex{lua.bytecode} array is stored inside the format
file as actual \LUA\ bytecode, so it can also be used to preload \LUA\ code.

Note: The function must not contain any upvalues. Currently, functions
containing upvalues can be stored (and their upvalues are set to
\type{nil}), but this is an artefact of the current \LUA\
implementation and thus subject to change.

The associated function calls are

\startfunctioncall
function f = lua.getbytecode(number n)
lua.setbytecode(number n, function f)
\stopfunctioncall

Note: Since a \LUA\ file loaded using \luatex{loadfile(filename)} is
essentially an anonymous function, a complete file can be stored in a
bytecode register like this:

\startfunctioncall
lua.bytecode[n] = loadfile(filename)
\stopfunctioncall

Now all definitions (functions, variables) contained in the file can be
created by executing this bytecode register:

\startfunctioncall
lua.bytecode[n]()
\stopfunctioncall

\section{The \luatex{kpse} library}

This library provides an interface to the \KPATHSEA\ file search method.

Before the search library can be used at all, its database has to be
initialized. When \LUATEX\ is used to typeset documents, this happens
automatically (that is, unless explicitly prohibited by the user's
startup script. See~\in{section}[init] for more details). In \TEXLUA\
mode, the initialization has to be done explicitly via the
\luatex{kpse.set_program_name} function.

\subsection{\luatex{kpse.set_program_name}}

Sets the \KPATHSEA\ executable (and optionally program) name

\startfunctioncall
kpse.set_program_name(string name)
kpse.set_program_name(string name, string progname)
\stopfunctioncall

The second argument controls the use of the \quote{dotted} values in the
\type{texmf.cnf} configuration file, and defaults to the first argument.


\subsection{\luatex{kpse.find_file}}

The most often used function in the library is find_file:

\startfunctioncall
string f = kpse.find_file(string filename)
string f = kpse.find_file(string filename, string ftype)
string f = kpse.find_file(string filename, boolean mustexist)
string f = kpse.find_file(string filename, string ftype, boolean mustexist)
string f = kpse.find_file(string filename, string ftype, number dpi)
\stopfunctioncall

Arguments:
\startitemize[intro]

\sym{filename} 

the name of the file you want to find, with or without extension.

\sym{ftype}

maps to the \type {-format} argument of \KPSEWHICH.  The supported
 \type{ftype} values are the same as the ones supported by the 
standalone \type{kpsewhich} program:

\startsimplecolumns
\starttyping
'gf'
'pk'
'bitmap font'
'tfm'
'afm'
'base'
'bib'
'bst'
'cnf'
'ls-R'
'fmt'
'map'
'mem'
'mf'
'mfpool'
'mft'
'mp'
'mppool'
'MetaPost support'
'ocp'
'ofm'
'opl'
'otp'
'ovf'
'ovp'
'graphic/figure'
'tex'
'TeX system documentation'
'texpool'
'TeX system sources'
'PostScript header'
'Troff fonts'
'type1 fonts'
'vf'
'dvips config'
'ist'
'truetype fonts'
'type42 fonts'
'web2c files'
'other text files'
'other binary files'
'misc fonts'
'web'
'cweb'
'enc files'
'cmap files'
'subfont definition files'
'opentype fonts'
'pdftex config'
'lig files'
'texmfscripts'
\stoptyping
\stopsimplecolumns

The default type is \type{tex}.

\sym{mustexist}

is similar to \KPSEWHICH's \type{-must-exist}, and the default is \type{false}.
If you specify \type{true} (or a non|-|zero integer), then the \KPSE\ library
will search the disk as well as the \type {ls-R} databases.

\sym{dpi}

This is used for the size argument of the formats \type{pk}, \type{gf}, and \type{bitmap font}.
\stopitemize

\subsection{\luatex{kpse.init_prog}}

Extra initialization for programs that need to generate bitmap fonts.

\startfunctioncall
kpse.init_prog(string prefix, number base_dpi, string mfmode)
kpse.init_prog(string prefix, number base_dpi, string mfmode, string fallback)
\stopfunctioncall


\subsection{\luatex{kpse.readable_file}}

Test if an (absolute) file name is a readable file

\startfunctioncall
string f = kpse.readable_file(string name)
\stopfunctioncall

The return value is the actual absolute filename you should use,
because the disk name is not always the same as the requested name,
due to aliases and system|-|specific handling under e.g.\ \MSDOS.

Returns \lua {nil} if the file does not exist or is not readable.

\subsection{\luatex{kpse.expand_path}}

Like kpsewhich's \type {-expand-path}:

\startfunctioncall
string r = kpse.expand_path(string s)
\stopfunctioncall

\subsection{\luatex{kpse.expand_var}}

Like kpsewhich's  \type{-expand-var}:

\startfunctioncall
string r = kpse.expand_var(string s)
\stopfunctioncall

\section{The \luatex{status} library}

This contains a number of run|-|time configuration items that
you may find useful in message reporting, as well as an iterator
function that gets all of the names and values as a table.

\startfunctioncall
table info = status.list()
\stopfunctioncall

The keys in the table are the known items, the value is the current
value.

Almost all of the values in \type{status} are fetched through a
metatable at run|-|time whenever they are accessed, so you cannot use
\type{pairs} on \type{status}, but you {\it can\/} use \type{pairs}
on \type{info}, of course.

If you do not need the full list, you can also ask for a single item
by using its name as an index into \type{status}.

The current list is:

\section{The \luatex{font} library}

The font library provides the interface into the internals of the font
system, and also it contains helper functions to load traditional
\TEX\ font metrics formats. Other font loading functionality is
provided by the \luatex{fontforge} library that will be discussed in
the next section.

\subsection{Loading a \TFM\ file}

\startfunctioncall
table fnt = font.read_tfm(string name, number s)
\stopfunctioncall

The number is a bit special:

\startitemize
\item if it is positive, it specifies an \quote{at size} in scaled points.
\item if it is negative, its absolute value represents a \quote{scaled}
setting relative to the designsize of the font.
\stopitemize

The internal structure of the metrics font table that is returned is
explained in \in{chapter}[fonts].

\subsection{Loading a \VF\ file}

\startfunctioncall
table vf_fnt = font.read_vf(string name, number s)
\stopfunctioncall

The meaning of the number \type{s}, and the format of the returned
table is the silimar to the \luatex{read_tfm()} function.

\subsection{The fonts array}

The whole table of \TEX\ fonts is accessible from lua using a virtual array.

\starttyping
font.fonts[n] = { ... }
table f = font.fonts[n]
\stoptyping

See \in{chapter}[fonts] for the structure of the tables. Because this
is a virtual array, you cannot call \type{pairs} on it, but see below
for the \type{font.each} iterator.

The two metatable functions implementing the virtual array are:

\startfunctioncall
table f = font.getfont(number n)
font.setfont(number n, table f)
\stopfunctioncall

Also note the following: assignments can only be made to fonts that
have already been defined in \TEX, but have not been accessed {\it at
all\/} since that definition. This limits the usability of the write
access to \type{font.fonts} quite a lot, a less stringent ruleset will
likely be implemented later.

\subsection{Checking a font's status}

You can test for the status of a font by calling this function:

\startfunctioncall
boolean f = font.frozen(number n)
\stopfunctioncall

The return value is one of true (unassignable), false (can be changed)
or nil (not a valid font at all).

\subsection{Defining a font directly}

You can define your own font into \luatex{font.fonts}

\startfunctioncall
number i = font.define(table f)
\stopfunctioncall

The return value is the internal id number of the defined font (the
index into \luatex{font.fonts}). If the font creation fails, an error is
raised. The table is a font structure, as explained in
\in{chapter}[fonts].

\subsection{Currently active font}

\startfunctioncall
number i = font.current();
font.current(number i);
\stopfunctioncall

This gets or sets the currently used font number.

\subsection{Maximum font id}

\startfunctioncall
number i = font.max();
\stopfunctioncall

This is the largest used index in \type{font.fonts}.

\subsection{Iterating over all fonts}

\startfunctioncall
for i,v in font.each() do
  ...
end
\stopfunctioncall

This is an iterator over each of the defined \TEX\ fonts. The first
returned value is the index in \type{font.fonts}, the second the font
itself, as a lua table. The indices are listed incrementally, but they
do not always form an array of consecutive numbers: in some cases
there can be holes in the sequence.

\section{The \luatex{fontforge} library}

\subsection{Getting quick information on a font}

\startfunctioncall
local info = fontforge.info('filename')
\stopfunctioncall

This function returns either \type{nil}, or a \type{table}, or an
array of small tables (in the case of a TrueType collection). The
returned table(s) will contain six fairly interesting information
items from the font(s) defined by the file:

\starttabulate[|lT|l|p|]
\NC \ssbf key                      \NC \bf type \NC \bf explanation \NC\NR
\NC fontname                     \NC string   \NC the \quote{PostScript} name of the font\NC\NR
\NC fullname                     \NC string   \NC The formal name of the font\NC\NR
\NC familyname                   \NC string   \NC The family name this font belongs to\NC\NR
\NC weight                       \NC string   \NC A string indicating the color value of the font\NC\NR
\NC version                      \NC string   \NC The internal font version\NC\NR
\NC italicangle                  \NC float    \NC The slant angle\NC\NR
\stoptabulate

Getting information through this function is (sometimes much) more
efficient than loading the font properly, and is therefore handy when
you want to create a dictionary of available fonts based on a
directory contents.

\subsection{Loading an \OPENTYPE\ or \TRUETYPE\ file}

If you want to use an \OPENTYPE\ font, you have to get the metric
information from somewhere. Using the \type{fontforge} library, the
basic way to get that information is thus:


\starttyping
function load_font (filename)
  local metrics = nil
  local font = fontforge.open(filename)
  if font then 
     metrics = fontforge.to_table(font)
     fontforge.close(font)
  end
  return metrics 
end

myfont = load_font('/opt/tex/texmf/fonts/data/arial.ttf')
\stoptyping

The main function call is

\startfunctioncall
f, w = fontforge.open('filename')
\stopfunctioncall

The first return value is a table representation of the font. The
second return value is a table containing any warnings and errors
reported by fontforge while opening the font. In normal typesetting,
you would probably ignore the second argument, but it can be useful
for debugging purposes.

For \TRUETYPE\ collections (when filename ends in 'ttc'), you have to
use a second string argument to specify which font you want from the
collection.  Use one of the \type{fullname} strings that are returned
by \type{fontforge.info} for that.

\startfunctioncall
f, w = fontforge.open('filename','fullname')
\stopfunctioncall


The font file is parsed and partially interpreted by the font
loading routines from \FONTFORGE. The file format can be \OPENTYPE,
\TRUETYPE, \TRUETYPE\ Collection, \CFF, or \TYPEONE.

There are a few advantages to this approach compared to reading the
actual font file ourselves:

\startitemize

\item The font is automatically re|-|encoded, so that the \type{metrics}
   table for \TRUETYPE\ and \OPENTYPE\ fonts is using \UNICODE\ for
   the character indices.

\item Many features are pre|-|processed into a format that is easier to handle
   than just the bare tables would be.

\item \POSTSCRIPT|-|based \OPENTYPE\ fonts do not store the character height and
  depth in the font file, so the character boundingbox has to be
  calculated in some way.

\item In the future, it may be interesting to allow \LUA\ scripts access to
  the font program itself, perhaps even creating or changing the font.

\stopitemize

\subsection{Applying a \quote{feature file}}

You can apply a  \quote{feature file} to a loaded font:

\startfunctioncall
fontforge.apply_featurefile(f,'filename')
\stopfunctioncall

A \quote{feature file} is a textual representation of the features in an
OpenType font.  See
\hyphenatedurl{http://www.adobe.com/devnet/opentype/afdko/topic_feature_file_syntax.html}
and 
\hyphenatedurl{http://fontforge.sourceforge.net/featurefile.html}
for a more detailed description of feature files.


\subsection{Applying an \quote{afm file}}

You can apply a  \quote{afm file} to a loaded font:

\startfunctioncall
fontforge.apply_afmfile(f,'filename')
\stopfunctioncall

An \quote{afm file} is a textual representation of (some of) the metainformation
in a Type~1 font. See \hyphenatedurl{http://www.adobe.com/devnet/font/pdfs/5004.AFM_Spec.pdf}
for more information about afm files.

Note: if you \type{fontforge.open()} a PFB file named \type{font.pfb},
the library will automatically search for, and apply, \type{font.afm}
if it exists in the same directory as \type{font.pfb}. In that case,
there is no need for an explicit call to \type{apply_afmfile()}.

The \type{lookups} is a hash based on lookup subtable names, with 
the value of each key inside that a linear array of small hashes:

\stoptabulate

For the first seven values of \type{type}, there can be additional
sub|-|information, stored in the sub-table \type{specification}:

\starttabulate[|lT|l|l|p|]
\NC \bf value    \NC \bf type \NC \bf explanation \NC\NR
\NC position     \NC table    \NC a table of the \type {offset_specs} type\NC\NR
\NC pair         \NC table    \NC one string: \type {paired}, and an array of one or

\NC lcaret       \NC array    \NC linear array of numbers\NC\NR
\stoptabulate

Tables for \type{offset_specs} contain up to four number|-|valued
fields: \type{x} (a horizontal offset), \type{y} (a vertical offset),
\type{h} (an advance width correction) and \type{v} (an advance height
correction).

The \type{ligatures} is a linear array of small hashes:

\starttabulate[|lT|l|p|]
\NC \ssbf key            \NC \bf type \NC \bf explanation \NC\NR
\NC lig                \NC table    \NC uses the same substructure as a single \type{possub} item\NC\NR

\NC ccnt               \NC number   \NC \NC\NR
\stoptabulate

The \type{anchor} table is indexed by a string signifying the 
anchor type, which is one of 

\starttabulate[|lT|l|p|]
\NC \ssbf key            \NC \bf type \NC \bf explanation \NC\NR
\NC mark              \NC table   \NC placement mark\NR

\NC centry            \NC table   \NC cursive entry point\NR
\NC cexit             \NC table   \NC cursive exit point\NR
\stoptabulate

The content of these is an short array of defined anchors, with the
entry keys being the anchor names. For all except \type{baselig}, the
value is a single table with this definition:

\starttabulate[|lT|l|p|]
\NC \ssbf key            \NC \bf type \NC \bf explanation \NC\NR
\NC x                  \NC number   \NC x location\NC\NR
\NC y                  \NC number   \NC y location\NC\NR
\NC ttf_pt_index       \NC number   \NC truetype point index, only if given\NC\NR
\stoptabulate

For \type{baselig}, the value is a small array of such anchor sets
sets, one for each constituent item of the ligature.

For clarification, an anchor table could for example look like this :
\starttyping
  ['anchor']={
    ['basemark']={
     ['Anchor-7']={ ['x']=170, ['y']=1080 }
    },
    ['mark']={
     ['Anchor-1'] ={ ['x']=160, ['y']=810 },
     ['Anchor-4']= { ['x']=160, ['y']=800 }
    },
    ['baselig']={
     [1] = { ['Anchor-2'] ={ ['x']=160, ['y']=650 } }, 
     [2] = { ['Anchor-2']= { ['x']=460, ['y']=640 } }
    }
   },

\subsubsection{map table}

The top|-|level map is a list of encoding mappings. Each of those is a table itself.

\NC enc                \NC table    \NC \NC\NR
\stoptabulate

The \type{remap} table is very small:

\section{The \luatex{lang} library}

This library provides the interface to \LUATEX's structure
representing a language, and the associated functions.

\startfunctioncall
<language> l = lang.new()
<language> l = lang.new(number id)
\stopfunctioncall

This function creates a new userdata object. An object of type
\type{<language>} is the first argument to most of the other functions
in the \luatex{lang} library. These functions can also be used as if
they were object methods, using the colon syntax.

Without an argument, the next available internal id number will be
assigned to this object. With argument, an object will be created that
links to the internal language with that id number.

\startfunctioncall
number n = lang.id(<language> l)
\stopfunctioncall

returns the internal \tex{language} id number this object refers to.

\startfunctioncall
string n = lang.hyphenation(<language> l)
lang.hyphenation(<language> l, string n)
\stopfunctioncall

Either returns the current hyphenation exceptions for this language,
or adds new ones. The syntax of the string is explained in the next
chapter,~\in{section}[patternsexceptions].

\startfunctioncall
lang.clear_hyphenation(<language> l)
\stopfunctioncall

Clears the exception dictionary for this language.

\startfunctioncall
string n = lang.clean(string o)
\stopfunctioncall

Creates a hypenation key from the supplied hyphenation value. The
syntax of the argument string is explained in the next
chapter,~\in{section}[patternsexceptions]. This function is useful if
you want to do something else based on the words in a dictionary file,
like spell-checking.

\startfunctioncall
string n = lang.patterns(<language> l)
lang.patterns(<language> l, string n)
\stopfunctioncall

Adds additional patterns for this language object, or returns the
current set. The syntax of this string is explained in the next
chapter,~\in{section}[patternsexceptions].

\startfunctioncall
lang.clear_patterns(<language> l)
\stopfunctioncall

Clears the pattern dictionary for this language.

\startfunctioncall
number n = lang.prehyphenchar(<language> l)
lang.prehyphenchar(<language> l, number n)
\stopfunctioncall

Gets or sets the \quote{pre-break} hyphen character for this font
(initially the hyphen, decimal 45).

\startfunctioncall
number n = lang.posthyphenchar(<language> l)
lang.posthyphenchar(<language> l, number n)
\stopfunctioncall

Gets or sets the \quote{post-break} hyphen character for this font
(initially null, decimal 0).


\startfunctioncall
boolean success = lang.hyphenate(<node> head)
boolean success = lang.hyphenate(<node> head, <node> tail)
\stopfunctioncall

Inserts hyphenation points (discretionary nodes) in a node list. If
\type{tail} is given as argument, processings stops on that node. 
Currently, \type{succes} is always true if \type{head} (and \type{tail}, if
specified) are proper nodes, regardless of possible other errors.

\chapter[languages]{Languages and characters, Fonts and glyphs}

\LUATEX's internal handling of the characters and glyphs that eventually 
become typeset is quite different from the way \TEX82 handles those
same objects. The easiest way to explain the difference is to focus on
unrestricted horizontal mode (i.e.\ paragraphs) and hyphenation first.
Later on, it will be easy to deal with the differences that occur in
horizontal and math modes.

In \TEX82, the characters you type are converted into \type{char_node}
records when they are encountered by the main control loop. \TEX\
attaches and processes the font information while creating those
records, so that the resulting \quote{horizontal list} contains the final
forms of ligatures and implicit kerning. 

When it becomes necessary to hyphenate words in a paragraph, \TEX\
converts (one word at time) the \type{char_node} records into a
string array by replacing ligatures with their components and
ignoring the kerning. Then it runs the hyphenation algorithm on this
string, and converts the hyphenated result back into a
\quote{horizontal list} that is consecutively spliced back into 
the paragraph stream.

The \type{char_node} records are somewhat misnamed, as they are glyph
posisitions in specific fonts, and therefore not really \quote{characters}
in the linguistic sense. There is no language information inside the
\type{char_node} records. Instead, language information is passed along 
using \type{language whatsit} records inside the horizontal list.

IN \LUATEX, the situation is quite different. The characters you
type are always converted into \type{glyph_node} records with a
special subtype to identify them as being intended as linguistic
characters. \LUATEX\ stores the needed language information in those
records, but does not do any font-related processing at the time of
node creation.

When it becomes necessary to typeset a paragraph, \LUATEX\ first
inserts all hyphenation points right into the whole node list.
Next, it processes all the font information in the whole list
(creating ligatures and adjusting kerning), and finally it adjusts
all the subtype identifiers so that the records are \quote{glyph
nodes} from now on.

That was the broad overview. The rest of this chapter will deal with the
minutiae of the new process.

\section[charsandglyphs]{Characters and glyphs}

\TEX82 (including \PDFTEX) differentiated between \type{char_node}s
and \type{lig_node}s.  The former are simple items that contained
nothing but a \quote{character} and a \quote{font} field, and they
lived in the same memory are as tokens. The latter also contained a
list of components, and a subtype indicating whether this ligature was
the result of a word boundary, and it was stored in the same place as
other nodes like boxes and kerns and glues.

In \LUATEX, these two types are merged into one, somewhat larger
structure called a \type{glyph_node}. Besides having the old
character, font, and component fields, and the new special fields like
\quote{attr} (see~\in{section}[glyphnodes]), these nodes also contain:

\startitemize
\item A subtype, split into four main types: 
   \startitemize 
   \item \quote{character} -- for characters to be hyphenated
   \item \quote{glyph}  -- for specific font glyphs
   \item \quote{ligature}  -- for ligatures
   \item \quote{ghost}  -- for \quote{ghost objects}
   \stopitemize
   The latter two make further use of two extra fields:
   \startitemize 
   \item \quote{left}  -- for ligatures: created from a left word boundary. 
                    for ghosts:  created from \tex{leftghost}
   \item \quote{right} -- for ligatures: created from a right word boundary. 
                    for ghosts:  created from \tex{rightghost}
   \stopitemize
   for ligatures, both bits can be set at the same time (in case of a single-glyph word).

\item \type{glyph_node}s of type \quote{character} also contain language data, 
  split into four items that were current when the node was created:
  the \tex{setlanguage} (15 bits), \tex{lefthyphenmin} (8 bits),
  \tex{righthyphenmin} (8 bits), and \tex{uchyph} (1 bit).
\stopitemize

Incidentally, \LUATEX\ allows 32768 separate languages, and words can
be 256 characters long.

Because the \tex{uchyph} value is saved in the actual nodes, its
handling is subtly different from \TEX82: changes to \tex{uchyph}
become effective immediately, not at the end of the current partial
paragraph.

Typeset boxes now always have their language information embedded in
the nodes themselves, so there is no longer a possible dependancy on
the surrounding language settings. In \TEX82, a mid-paragraph
statement like \type{\unhbox0} would process the box using the current
paragraph language unless there was a \tex{setlanguage} issued inside
the box. In \LUATEX, all language variables are already frozen.


\section{The main control loop}

In \LUATEX's main loop, almost all input characters that are to be
typeset are converted into \type{glyph_node} records with subtype
\quote{character}, but there are a few small exceptions.

First, the \tex{accent} primitives creates nodes with subtype \quote{glyph}
instead of \quote{character}: one for the actual accent and one for the
accentee. The primary reason for this is that \tex{accent} in \TEX82
is explicitly dependant on the current font encoding, so it would not
make much sense to attach a new meaning to the primitive's name, as
that would invalidate many old documents and macro packages. A
secondary reason is that in \TEX82, \tex{accent} prohibits hyphenation
of the current word. Since in \LUATEX\ hyphenation only takes place on
\quote{character} nodes, it is possible to achieve the same effect.

This change of meaning did happen with \tex{char}, that now generates
\quote{character} nodes, consistent with its changed meaning in \XETEX.
The changed status of \tex{char} is not yet finalized, but if it stays
as it is now, a new primitive \tex{glyph} should be added to directly
insert a font glyph id.

Second, all the results of processing in math mode eventually become
nodes with \quote{glyph} subtypes.

Third, the \ALEPH-derived commands \tex{leftghost} and
\tex{rightghost} create nodes of a third subtype: \quote{ghost}. These nodes
are ignored completely by all further processing until the stage where
inter-glyph kerning is added.

Fourth, automatic discretionaries are handled differently. \TEX82
inserts an empty discretionary after sensing an input character that
matches the \tex{hyphenchar} in the current font. This test is wrong,
in our opinion: wether or not hyphenation takes place should not
depend on the current font, it is a language property.

In \LUATEX, it works like this: if \LUATEX\ senses a string of input
characters that matches the value of the new integer parameter
\tex{exhyphenchar}, it will insert an empty discretionary after that
series of nodes. Initex sets the \type{\exhyphenchar=`\-}. 
Incidentally, this is a global parameter instead of a
language-specific one because it may be useful to change the value
depending on the document structure instead of the text language. 

The exact status and meaning of \tex{hyphenchar} is still under
consideration, it will probably become used in the character to glyph
conversion stage. Currently, it is simply ignored.

Fifth, \tex{setlanguage} no longer creates whatsits. The meaning of
\tex{setlanguage} is changed so that it is now an integer parameter 
like all others. That integer parameter is used in \tex{glyph_node}
creation to add language information to the glyph nodes. In
conjunction, the \tex{language} primitive is extended so that it
always also updates the value of \tex{setlanguage}.

Sixth, the \tex{noboundary} command (this command prohibits word
boundary processing where that would normally take place) now does
create whatsits. These whatsits are needed because the exact place of
the \tex{noboundary} command in the input stream has to be retained
until after the ligature and font processing stages.

Finally, there is no longer a \type{main_loop} label in the
code. Remember that \TEX82 did quite a lot of processing while adding
\type{char_nodes} to the horizontal list? For speed reasons, it handled 
that processing code outside of the \quote{main control} loop, and only the
first character of any \quote{word} was handled by that \quote{main control} loop.
In \LUATEX, there is no longer a need for that (all hard work is done
later), and the (now very small) bits of character-handling code have
been moved back inline. When \tex{tracingcommands} is on, this is
visible because the full word is reported, instead of just the initial
character.


\section[patternsexceptions]{Loading patterns and exceptions}

The hyphenation algorithm in \LUATEX\ is quite different from the one
in \TEX82, although it uses essentially the same user input.

After expansion, the argument for \tex{patterns} has to be proper
UTF-8, no \tex{char} or \tex{chardef-ed} commands are allowed. (The
current implementation is even more strict, and will reject all
non-unicode characters, but that will be changed in the future. For
now, the generated errors are a valuable tool in discovering
font-encoding specific pattern files)

Likewise, the expanded argument for \tex{hyphenation} also has to be
proper UTF-8, but here a tiny little bit of extra syntax is provided:

\startitemize[n]
\item three sets of arguments in curly braces (\type{{}{}{}})
   indicates a desired complex discretionary, with arguments 
   as in \tex{discretionary}'s command in normal document input.
\item \type{-} indicates a desired simple discretionary,  cf. \type{\-} and 
   \type{\discretionary{-}{}{}} in normal document input.
\item Internal command names are ignored. This rule is provided 
   especially for \tex{discretionary}, but it also helps deal with
  \tex{relax} commands that may sneak in.
\item \type{=} indicates a hyphen in the document input (but that
  is only useful in documents where \tex{exhyphenchar} is not equal to
  the hyphen).
\stopitemize

The expanded argument is first converted back to a space-separated
string while dropping the internal command names. This string is then
converted into a dictionary by a routine that creates key||value pairs
by converting the other listed items. It is important to note that the
keys in an exception dictionary can always be generated from the
values. Here are a few examples:

\starttabulate[|l|l|l|]
\NC \ssbf value          \NC \ssbf implied key (input) \NC \ssbf effect\NC\NR 
\NC \type{ta-ble}        \NC table  \NC \type{ta\-ble} 
                                        ($=$ \type{ta\discretionary{-}{}{}ble})\NC\NR
\NC \type{ba{k-}{}{c}ken}\NC backen \NC \type{ba\discretionary{k-}{}{c}ken}\NC\NR
\stoptabulate

The resultant patterns and exception dictionary will be stored under
the language code that is the present value of \tex{language}. 

In the last line of the table, you see there is no \tex{discretionary}
command in the value: the command is optional in the \TEX-based input
syntax. The underlying reason for that is that it is conceivable that
a whole dictionary of words is stored as a plain text file and loaded
into \LUATEX\ using one of the functions in the Lua \luatex{lang}
library. This loading method is quite a bit faster than going through
the \TEX\ language primitives, but some (most?) of that speed gain
would be lost if it had to interpret command sequences while doing so.

The motivation behind the \ETEX\ extension \tex{savinghyphcodes} was
that hyphenation heavily depended on font encodings. This is no longer
true in \LUATEX, and the corresponding primitive is ignored pending
complete removal. The future semantics of \tex{uppercase} and
\tex{lowercase} are still under consideration, no changes have taken
place yet.


\section{Applying hyphenation}

The internal structures \LUATEX\ uses for the insertion of
discretionaries in words is very different from the ones in \TEX82,
and that means there are some noticable differences in handling as
well.

First and foremost, there is no \quote{compressed trie} involved in
hyphenation. The algorithm still reads \PATGEN-generated pattern
files, but \LUATEX\ uses a finite state hash to match the patterns
against the word to be hyphenated. This algorithm is based on the
\quote{libhnj} library used by OpenOffice. 
The memory allocation for this new implementation is completely
dynamic, so the \WEBC\ setting for \type{trie_size} is ignored.

Differences between \LUATEX\ and \TEX82 that are a direct result of that:

\startitemize
\item \LUATEX\ happily hyphenates the full Unicode character range.
\item Pattern and exception dictionary size is limited by the
  available memory only, all allocations are done dynamically.
  The trie-related settings in \type{texmf.cnf} are ignored.
\item Because there is no \quote{trie preparation} stage, language patterns 
  never become frozen. This means that the primitive \tex{patterns}
  (and its lua counterpart \luatex{lang.patterns}) can be used at any
  time, not only in initex.
\item Only the string representation of \tex{patterns} and 
  \tex{hyphenation} is stored in the format file. At format load time,
  they are simply re-evaluated. It follows that there is no real 
  reason to preload languages in the format file. In fact, it is 
  usually not a good idea to do so. It is much smarter to load 
  patterns no sooner than the first time they are actually needed.
\item \LUATEX\ uses the language-specific variables
\tex{prehyphenchar} and \tex{posthyphenchar} in the creation of 
discretionaries, instead of \TEX82's \tex{hyphenchar}.
\stopitemize

Previously, there were problems with changing the node attributes
mid-word, but that problem is now solved, as nodes in a word are not
converted to and from a string any more (this was required by the old
hyphenation code), they are editted in place. Inserted characters and
ligatures inherit their attributes from the nearest glyph node item
(usually the preceding one, but the following one for the items
inserted at the left-hand side of a word).

Word boundaries are no longer implied by font switches, but by
language switches. One word can have two separate fonts and still be
hyphenated correctly (but it can not have two different languages,
the \tex{setlanguage} command forces a word boundary).

All languages start out with \type{\prehyphenchar=`\-} and
\type{\posthyphenchar=0}. When you assign the values of
\tex{prehyphenchar} and \tex{posthyphenchar}, you are actually
changing the settings for the current \tex{language}, this behaviour
is compatible with \tex{patterns} and \tex{hyphenation}.

\LUATEX\ also hyphenates the first word in a paragraph. 

Words can be up to 256 characters long (up from 64 in \TEX82).  Longer
words generate an error right now, but eventually either the
limitation will be removed or perhaps it will become possbile to
silently ignore the excess characters (this is what happens in \TEX82,
but there the behaviour cannot be controlled).

If you are using the Lua function \type{lang.hyphenate}, you should be
aware that this function expects to receive a list of \quote{character}
nodes. It will not operate properly in the presence of \quote{glyph},
\quote{ligature}, or \quote{ghost} nodes, nor does it know how to deal with
kerning.  In the near future, it will be able to skip over \quote{ghost}
nodes, and we may add a less fuzzy function you can call as well.

The hyphenation exception dictionary is maintained as key-value
hash, and that is also dynamic, so the \type{hyph_size} setting is not
used either.

A technical paper detailing the new algorithm will be released as a
separate document.

\section{Applying ligatures and kerning}

After all possible hyphenation points have been inserted in the list,
\LUATEX\ will process the list to convert the \quote{character} nodes into 
\quote{glyph} and \quote{ligature} nodes. This is actually done in two stages:
first all ligatures are processed, then all kerning information is
applied to the result list. But those two stages are somewhat
dependant on each other: If the used font makes it possible to do so,
the ligaturing stage adds virtual \quote{character} nodes to the word
boundaries in the list. While doing so, it removes and interprets
\type{noboundary} nodes. The kerning stage deletes those word boundary 
items after it is done with them, and it does the same for \quote{ghost}
nodes. Finally, at the end of the kerning stage, all remaining
\quote{character} nodes are converted to \quote{glyph} nodes.

This work separation is worth mentioning because, if you overrule from
Lua only one of the two callbacks related to font handling, then you
have to make sure you perform the tasks normally done by \LUATEX\
itself in order to make sure that the other, non-overrruled, routine
continues to function properly.

Work in this area is not yet complete, but most of the possible cases
are handled by our rewritten ligaturing engine. We are working hard to
make sure all of the possible inputs will become supported soon.

For example, take the word \type{office}, hyphenated \type{of-fice},
using a \quote{normal} font with all the \type{f}-\type{i} ligatures:
\starttabulate[|l|l|]
\NC Initial:               \NC \type{{o}{f}{f}{i}{c}{e}}           \NC\NR
\NC After hyphenation:     \NC \type{{o}{f}{{-},{},{}}{f}{i}{c}{e}}\NC\NR
\NC First ligature stage:  \NC \type{{o}{{f}{-},{f},{ff}}{i}{c}{e}}\NC\NR
\NC Final result:          \NC \type{{o}{{f}{-},{fi},{ffi}}{c}{e}} \NC\NR
\stoptabulate

That's bad enough, but if there was a hyphenation point between the
\type{f} and the \type{i}: \type{of-f-ice}, the final result should be: 
\starttyping
   {o}{{f}{-},
       {{f}{-},
        {i},
        {fi}},
       {{ff}{-},
        {i},
        {ffi}}}{c}{e}
\stoptyping
with discretionaries in the post-break text as well as in the
replacement text of the top-level discretionary that resulted from the
first hyphenation point.  And this is only a simple case.

\section{Breaking paragraphs into lines}

This code is still almost unchanged, but because of the
above-mentioned changes with respect to discretionaries and ligatures,
line breaking will potentially be different from traditional \TEX.
The actual line breaking code is still based on the \TEX82 algoritms,
and it does not expect there to be discretionaries inside of
discretionaries. 

But that situation is now fairly common in \LUATEX, due to the changes
to the ligaturing mechanism. And also, the \LUATEX\ discretionary
nodes are implemented slightly different from the \TEX82 nodes: the
\type{no_break} text is now embedded inside the disc node where 
previously, these nodes kept their place in the horizontal list (the
discretionary node contained a counter indicating how many nodes to
skip).

The combined effect of these two differences is that \LUATEX\ does not
always use all of the potential breakpoints in a paragraph, especially
when fonts with many ligatures are used.

\chapter[fonts]{Font structure}

All \TEX\ fonts are represented to \LUA\ code as tables, and
internally as C~structures. All keys in the table below are saved in
the internal font structure if they are present in the table returned
by the
\luatex{define_font} callback, or if they result from the normal \TFM|/|\VF\
reading routines if there is no \luatex{define_font} callback defined.

The column \quote{from \VF} means that this key will be created by the
\luatex{font.read_vf()} routine, \quote{from \TFM} means that the key will be created
by the \luatex{font.read_tfm()} routine, and \quote{used} means whether or not the
\LUATEX\ engine itself will do something with the key.

The top|-|level keys in the table are as follows:

\starttabulate[|l|l|l|l|l|p|]

\stoptabulate

The key \type{name} is always required.

The keys \type{stretch}, \type{shrink}, \type{step} and optionally \type{auto_expand} 
only have meaning when used together: they can be used to replace a post-loading
\type{\pdffontexpand} command. 

The \type{expansion_factor} is value that can be present inside a font in \type{font.fonts}.
It is the actual expansion factor (a value between \type{-shrink} and \type{stretch}, with
step \type{step}) of a font that was automatically generated by the font expansion algorithm.

The key \type{attributes} can be used to replace \type{\pdffontattr}.

The key \type{used} is set by the engine when a font is actively in
use, this makes sure that the font's definition is written to the
output file (\DVI\ or \PDF). The \TFM\ reader sets it to false.

The \type{direction} is a number signalling the \quote{normal} direction for
this font. There are sixteen possibilities:

\starttabulate[|c|c|c|c|]
\NC \bf number \NC \bf meaning \NC \bf number \NC \bf meaning \NC\NR
\NC 0          \NC LT          \NC 8          \NC TT          \NC\NR
\NC 1          \NC LL          \NC 9          \NC TL          \NC\NR
\NC 2          \NC LB          \NC 10         \NC TB          \NC\NR
\NC 3          \NC LR          \NC 11         \NC TR          \NC\NR
\NC 4          \NC RT          \NC 12         \NC BT          \NC\NR
\NC 5          \NC RL          \NC 13         \NC BL          \NC\NR
\NC 6          \NC RB          \NC 14         \NC BB          \NC\NR
\NC 7          \NC RR          \NC 15         \NC BR          \NC\NR
\stoptabulate

These are \OMEGA|-|style direction abbreviations: the first character
indicates the \quote{first} edge of the character glyphs (the edge that is
seen first in the writing direction), the second the \quote{top} side.

The \type{parameters} is a hash with mixed key types. There are seven
possible string keys, as well as a number of integer indices (these
start from 8 up). The seven strings are actually used instead of the
bottom seven indices, because that gives a nicer user interface.

The names and their internal remapping:

\starttabulate[|l|c|]
\NC \bf name      \NC \bf internal remapped number \NC\NR
\NC slant         \NC 1  \NC\NR
\NC space         \NC 2  \NC\NR
\NC space_stretch \NC 3  \NC\NR
\NC space_shrink  \NC 4  \NC\NR
\NC x_height      \NC 5  \NC\NR
\NC quad          \NC 6  \NC\NR
\NC extra_space   \NC 7  \NC\LR
\stoptabulate

The keys \type{type}, \type{format}, \type{embedding}, \type{fullname} and
\type{filename} are used to embed \OPENTYPE\ fonts in the result \PDF.

The \type{characters} table is a list of character hashes indexed by
integer number. The number is the \quote{internal code} \TEX\ knows this
character by.

Two very special string indexes can be used also: \type{left_boundary} is a
virtual character whose ligatures and kerns are used to handle word
boundary processing. \type{right_boundary} is similar but not actually
used for anything (yet!).

Other index keys are ignored.

Each character hash itself is a hash. For example, here is the
character \quote{f} (decimal 102) in the font cmr10 at 10 points:

\starttyping
[102] = {
  ['width'] = 200250
  ['height'] = 455111,
  ['depth'] = 0,
  ['italic'] = 50973,
  ['kerns'] = {
     [63] = 50973,
     [93] = 50973,
     [39] = 50973,
     [33] = 50973,
     [41] = 50973
  },
  ['ligatures'] = {
    [102] = {
       ['char'] = 11,
       ['type'] = 0
    },
    [108] = {
       ['char'] = 13,
       ['type'] = 0
    },
    [105] = {
       ['char'] = 12,
       ['type'] = 0
    }
  },
}
\stoptyping

The following top|-|level keys can be present inside a character hash:

\starttabulate[|l|c|c|c|l|p|]
\NC \ssbf key    \NC \bf from vf \NC \bf from tfm \NC \bf used \NC \bf value type \NC \bf description \NC\NR

\NC italic     \NC no          \NC yes          \NC yes      \NC number         \NC character's italic correction, in sp (default zero) \NC\NR

\stoptabulate

The values of \type{left_protruding} and \type{right_protruding} are used only when
\type{\pdfprotrudechars} is non-zero.

Whether or not \type{expansion_factor} is used depends on the font's global expansion
settings, as well as on the value of \type{\pdfadjustspacing}.

The usage of \type{tounicode} is this: if this font specifies a \type{tounicode=1} at
the top level, then \LUATEX\ will construct a \type{/ToUnicode} entry for the PDF
font (or font subset) based on the character-level \type{tounicode} strings, where
they are available. If a character does not have a sensible Unicode equivalent,
do not provide a string either (no empty strings).

If the font-level \type{tounicode} is not set, then \LUATEX\ will build up
\type{/ToUnicode} based on the \TEX\ code points you used, and any character-level
\type{tounicodes} will be ignored. {\it At the moment, the string format is exactly the
format that is expected by Adobe CMAP files (UTF-16BE in hexadecimal encoding), minus
the enclosing angle brackets. This may change in the future.}. Small example: the
\type{tounicode} for a \type{fi} ligature would be \type{00660069}.

The presence of \type{extensible} will overrule \type{next}, if that is also present.

The \type{extensible} table is very simple:

\starttabulate[|l|l|p|]
\NC \ssbf key \NC \bf type \NC \bf description                    \NC\NR
\NC top     \NC number   \NC \quote{top} character index        \NC\NR
\NC mid     \NC number   \NC \quote{middle} character index     \NC\NR
\NC bot     \NC number   \NC \quote{bottom} character index     \NC\NR
\NC rep     \NC number   \NC \quote{repeatable} character index \NC\NR
\stoptabulate

The \type{kerns} table is a hash indexed by character index (and
\quote{character index} is defined as either a non|-|negative integer or the
string value \type {right_boundary}), with the values the kerning to be
applied, in scaled points.

The \type{ligatures} table is a hash indexed by character index (and
\quote{character index} is defined as either a non|-|negative integer or the
string value \type {right_boundary}), with the values being yet another small
hash, with two fields:

\starttabulate[|l|l|p|]
\NC \ssbf key \NC \bf type \NC \bf description \NC\NR
\NC type    \NC number   \NC the type of this ligature command, default 0 \NC\NR
\NC char    \NC number   \NC the character index of the resultant ligature \NC\NR
\stoptabulate

The \type{char} field in a ligature is required.

The \type{type} field inside a ligature is the numerical or string value of one of the eight
possible ligature types supported by \TEX.  When \TEX\ inserts a new ligature, it puts the new
glyph in the middle of the left and right glyphs. The original left and right glyphs can
optionally be retained, and when at least one of them is kept, it is also possible to move the
new \quote{insertion point} forward one or two places. The glyph that ends up to the right of the
insertion point will become the next \quote{left}.

\starttabulate[|l|c|l|l|]
\NC \bf textual (Knuth) \NC \bf number \NC \bf string    \NC result \NC\NR
\NC l + r =: n          \NC 0          \NC \type{=:}     \NC \|n    \NC\NR
\NC l + r =:\| n        \NC 1          \NC \type{=:|}    \NC \|nr   \NC\NR
\NC l + r \|=: n        \NC 2          \NC \type{|=:}    \NC \|ln   \NC\NR
\NC l + r \|=:\| n      \NC 3          \NC \type{|=:|}   \NC \|lnr  \NC\NR
\NC l + r  =:\|\> n     \NC 5          \NC \type{=:|>}   \NC n\|r   \NC\NR
\NC l + r \|=:\> n      \NC 6          \NC \type{|=:>}   \NC l\|n   \NC\NR
\NC l + r \|=:\|\> n    \NC 7          \NC \type{|=:|>}  \NC l\|nr  \NC\NR
\NC l + r \|=:\|\>\> n  \NC 11         \NC \type{|=:|>>} \NC ln\|r  \NC\NR
\stoptabulate

The default value is~0, and can be left out. That signifies a \quote{normal}
ligature where the ligature replaces both original glyphs. In this table
the~\| indicates the final insertion point.

The \type{commands} array is explained below.

\section {Real fonts}

Whether or not a \TEX\ font is a \quote{real} font that should be written to
the \PDF\ document is decided by the \type{type} value in the top|-|level
font structure. If the value is \type{real}, then this is a proper
font, and the inclusion mechanism will attempt to add the needed
font object definitions to the \PDF.

Values for \type{type}:

\starttabulate[|l|p|]
\NC \bf value     \NC \bf description        \NC\NR
\NC real          \NC this is a base font    \NC\NR
\NC virtual       \NC this is a virtual font \NC\NR
\stoptabulate

The actions to be taken depend on a number of different variables:

\startitemize[packed]
\item Whether the used font fits in an 8-bit encoding scheme or not
\item The type of the disk font file
\item The level of embedding requested
\stopitemize

A font that uses anything other than an 8-bit encoding vector has to
be written to the \PDF\ in a different way.

The rule is: if the font table has \type {encodingbytes} set to~2,
then this is a wide font, in all other cases it isn't. The value~2 is
the default for \OPENTYPE\ and \TRUETYPE\ fonts loaded via \LUA. For
\TYPEONE\ fonts, you have to set \type {encodingbytes} to~2
explicitly. For \PK\ bitmap fonts, wide font encoding is not
supported at all.

If no special care is needed, \LUATEX\ currently falls back to the
mapfile|-|based solution used by \PDFTEX\ and \DVIPS. This behaviour
will be removed in the future, when the existing code becomes
integrated in the new subsystem.

But if this is a \quote{wide} font, then the new subsystem kicks in, and
some extra fields have to be present in the font structure. In this
case, \LUATEX\ does not use a map file at all.

The extra fields are: \type{format}, \type{embedding}, \type{fullname},
\type{cidinfo} (as explained above), \type{filename}, and the
\type{index} key in the separate characters.

Values for \type{format} are:

\starttabulate[|l|p|]
\NC \bf value \NC \bf description                                           \NC\NR
\NC type1     \NC this is a \POSTSCRIPT\ \TYPEONE\ font                     \NC\NR
\NC type3     \NC this is a bitmapped (\PK) font                            \NC\NR
\NC truetype  \NC this is a \TRUETYPE\ or \TRUETYPE|-|based \OPENTYPE\ font \NC\NR
\NC opentype  \NC this is a \POSTSCRIPT|-|based \OPENTYPE\ font             \NC\NR
\stoptabulate

(\type{type3} fonts are provided for backward compatibility only, and do not
support the new wide encoding options.)

Values for \type{embedding} are:

\starttabulate[|l|p|]
\NC \bf value \NC \bf description \NC\NR
\NC no        \NC don't embed the font at all \NC\NR
\NC subset    \NC include and atttempt to subset the font \NC\NR
\NC full      \NC include this font in its entirety \NC\NR
\stoptabulate

It is not possible to artificially modify the transformation matrix
for the font at the moment.

The other fields are used as follows: The \type{fullname} will be the
\POSTSCRIPT|/|\PDF\ font name. The \type{cidinfo} will be used as the
character set (the CID \type{/Ordering} and \type{/Registry} keys). The
\type{filename} points to the actual font file. If you include the
full path in the \type{filename} or if the file is in the local
directory, \LUATEX\ will run a little bit more efficient because it
will not have to re|-|run the \type{find_xxx_file} callback in that
case.

Be careful: when mixing old and new fonts in one document, it is possible to
create \POSTSCRIPT\ name clashes that can result in printing
errors. When this happens, you have to change the \type{fullname}
of the font.

Typeset strings are written out in a wide format using 2~bytes per
glyph, using the \type{index} key in the character information as
value. The overall effect is like having an encoding based on numbers
instead of traditional (\POSTSCRIPT) name|-|based reencoding. The way
to get the correct \type{index} numbers for \TYPEONE\ fonts is by
loading the font via \type{fontforge.open}; use the table indices as
\type{index} fields.

This type of reencoding means that there is no longer a clear
connection between the text in your input file and the strings in the
output \PDF\ file. Dealing with this is high on the agenda.

\section {Virtual fonts}

You have to take the following steps if you want \LUATEX\ to treat the
returned table from \luatex{define_font} as a virtual font:

\startitemize[packed]
\item Set the top|-|level key \type {type} to \type {virtual}.
\item Make sure there is at least one valid entry in \luatex{fonts} (see below)
\item Give a \type {commands} array to every character (see below)
\stopitemize

The presence of the toplevel \type {type} key with the specific value
\type {virtual} will trigger handling of the rest of the special virtual
font fields in the table, but the mere existance of 'type' is enough
to prevent \LUATEX\ from looking for a virtual font on its own.

Therefore, this also works \quote{in reverse}: if you are absolutely certain
that a font is not a virtual font, assigning the value \type{base} or
\type{real} to \type{type} will inhibit \LUATEX\ from looking for a virtual font
file, thereby saving you a disk search.

The \luatex{fonts} is another \LUA\ array. The values are one- or two|-|key
hashes themselves, each entry indicating one of the base fonts in a
virtual font. An example makes this easy to understand

\starttyping
fonts = { { name = 'ptmr8a', size = 655360},
          { name = 'psyr', size = 600000},
          { id = 38 } }
\stoptyping

says that the first referenced font (index 1) in this virtual font is
\type{ptrmr8a} loaded at 10pt, and the second is \type{psyr}  loaded
at a little over 9pt. The third one is previously defined font that
is known to \LUATEX\ as fontid \quote{38}.

The array index numbers are used by the character command definitions
that are part of each character.

The \luatex{commands} array is a hash here each item is another small array, with first
entry representing a command and the extra items the parameters to that command. The
allowed commands and their arguments are:

\starttabulate[|l|l|l|p|]
\NC \bf command name  \NC \bf arguments \NC \bf arg type \NC \bf description \NC\NR
\NC font              \NC 1         \NC number    \NC select a new font from the local \luatex{fonts} table\NC\NR
\NC char              \NC 1         \NC number    \NC typeset this character number from the current font, 
                                                      and move right by the character's width\NC\NR

                                                      by the width of this list\NC\NR
\NC slot              \NC 2         \NC number    \NC a shortcut for the combination of a font and char command\NC\NR
\NC push              \NC 0         \NC           \NC save current position\NC\NR
\NC nop               \NC 0         \NC           \NC do nothing \NC\NR
\NC pop               \NC 0         \NC           \NC pop position \NC\NR
\NC rule              \NC 2         \NC 2 numbers \NC output a rule $w*h$, and move right.\NC\NR
\NC down              \NC 1         \NC number    \NC move down on the page\NC\NR
\NC right             \NC 1         \NC number    \NC move right on the page\NC\NR
\NC special           \NC 1         \NC string    \NC output a \tex{special} command\NC\NR
\NC comment           \NC any       \NC any       \NC the arguments of this command are ignored\NC\NR
\stoptabulate

Here is a rather elaborate glyph commands example:
\starttyping
...
commands = {
  {'push'},                     -- remember where we are
  {'right', 5000},              -- move right about 0.08pt
  {'font', 3},                  -- select the fonts[3] entry
  {'char', 97},                 -- place character 97 (ASCII 'a')
  {'pop'},                      -- go all the way back
  {'down', -200000},            -- move upwards by about 3pt
  {'special', 'pdf: 1 0 0 rg'}  -- switch to red color
  {'rule', 500000, 20000}       -- draw a bar
  {'special','pdf: 0 g'}        -- back to black
}
...
\stoptyping

The default value for \type {font} is always~1 at the start of the \type{commands} array. 
Therefore, if the virtual font is essentially only a re|-|encoding, then you do usually not 
have create an explicit \quote{font} command in the array.

Rules inside of \type{commands} arrays are built up using only two dimensions: 
they do not have depth. For correct vertical placement, an extra \type{down} command 
may be needed.

Regardless of the amount of movement you create within the \type {commands},
the output pointer will always move by exactly the width that was given in
the \type {width} key of the character hash. Any movements that take place 
inside the \type{commands} array are ignored on the upper level.

\subsection{Artificial fonts}

Even in a \quote{real} font, there can be virtual characters. When \LUATEX\ encounters a \type {commands}
field inside a character when it becomes time to typeset the character, it will interpret the commands, just
like for a true virtual character. In this case, if you have created no \quote{fonts} array, then the default
(and only) \quote{base} font is taken to be the current font itself. In practise, this means that you can
create virtual duplicates of existing characters which is useful if you want to create composite characters.

Note: this feature does {\it not\/} work the other way around. There can not be \quote{real} characters in a
virtual font! You cannot use this technique for font re-encoding either; you need a truly virtual 
font for that (because characters that are already present cannot be altered).

\subsection{Example virtual font}

Finally, here is a plain \TEX\ input file with a virtual font demonstration:

\startbuffer
\directlua0 {
  callback.register('define_font',
    function (name,size)
      if name == 'cmr10-red' then
        f = font.read_tfm('cmr10',size)
        f.name = 'cmr10-red'
        f.type = 'virtual'
        f.fonts = {{ name = 'cmr10', size = size }}
        for i,v in pairs(f.characters) do
          if (string.char(i)):find('[tacohanshartmut]') then
             v.commands = {
               {'special','pdf: 1 0 0 rg'},
               {'char',i},
               {'special','pdf: 0 g'},
              }
          else
             v.commands = {{'char',i}}
          end
        end
      else
        f = font.read_tfm(name,size)
      end
      return f
    end
  )
}

\chapter[nodes]{Nodes}

\section{\LUA\ node representation}

\TEX's nodes are represented in \LUA\ as userdata object with a variable
set of fields. In the following syntax tables, such the type of such a
userdata object is represented as \syntax{<node>}.

 
The current return value of \luatex{node.types()} is: 
\ctxlua {
  local d = node.types()
  tex.print('\\type{' .. d[0] .. '} (' .. 0 .. '), ') 
  for _,v in pairs(d) do 
    if _ > 0 then
      tex.print('\\type{' .. v .. '} (' .. _ .. '), ') 
    end
  end 
} but as already mentioned, the math and alignment nodes
in this list are not supported at the moment. The useful list
is described in the next sections.

\subsection{Auxiliary items}

A few node|-|typed userdata objects do not occur in the \quote{normal}
list of nodes, but can be pointed to from within that list. They are
not quite the same as regular nodes, but it is easier for the library
routines to treat them as if they were.

\subsubsection{glue_spec items}

Skips are about the only type of data objects in traditional \TEX\
that are not a simple value. The structure that represents the glue
components of a skip is called a \type {glue_spec}, and it has the following
accessible fields:

\starttabulate[|lT|l|p|]
\NC \ssbf key            \NC \bf type \NC \bf explanation \NC\NR
\NC width          \NC number  \NC \NC\NR
\NC stretch        \NC number  \NC \NC\NR
\NC stretch_order  \NC number  \NC \NC\NR
\NC shrink         \NC number  \NC \NC\NR
\NC shrink_order   \NC number  \NC \NC\NR
\stoptabulate

These objects are reference counted, so there is actually an extra
field named \type {ref_count} as well. This item type will likely
disappear in the future, and the glue fields themselves will
become part of the nodes referencing glue items.

\subsubsection{attribute\_list and attribute items}

The newly introduced attribute registers are non|-|trivial, because
the value that is attached to a node is essentially a sparse array of
key|-|value pairs.

It is generally easiest to deal with attribute lists and attributes
by using the dedicated functions in the \luatex{node} library, but
for completeness, here is the low|-|level interface. 

An \type{attribute_list} item is used as a head pointer for a list
of attribute items. It has only one user-visible field:

\starttabulate[|lT|l|p|]
\NC \ssbf field     \NC \bf type \NC  \bf explanation \NC\NR
\NC next          \NC \syntax{<node>}  \NC pointer to the first attribute\NC\NR
\stoptabulate

A normal node's attribute field will point to an item of type
\type{attribute_list}, and the \type{next} field in that item will point 
to the first defined \quote{attribute} item, whose \type {next} will
point to the second \quote{attribute} item, etc.

Valid fields in \type{attribute} items:

\starttabulate[|lT|l|p|]
\NC \ssbf field     \NC \bf type \NC  \bf explanation \NC\NR
\NC next           \NC \syntax{<node>}  \NC pointer to the next attribute\NC\NR
\NC number         \NC number  \NC the attribute type id\NC\NR
\NC value          \NC number  \NC the attribute value\NC\NR
\stoptabulate

\subsubsection{action item}

Valid fields: \showfields{action}

These are a special kind of item that only appears inside
pdf start link objects. 

\starttabulate[|lT|l|p|]
\NC \ssbf field     \NC \bf type \NC  \bf explanation \NC\NR
\NC action_type   \NC  number   \NC  \NC\NR
\NC action_id     \NC  number or string   \NC  \NC\NR
\NC named_id      \NC  number   \NC  \NC\NR
\NC file          \NC  string   \NC  \NC\NR
\NC new_window    \NC  number   \NC  \NC\NR
\NC data          \NC  string   \NC  \NC\NR
\NC ref_count     \NC  number   \NC  \NC\NR
\stoptabulate

\subsection{Main text nodes}

These are the nodes that comprise actual typesetting commands. 

A few fields are present in all nodes regardless of their type, these are:

\starttabulate[|lT|l|p|]
\NC \ssbf field     \NC \bf type \NC  \bf explanation \NC\NR
\NC next    \NC \syntax{<node>}  \NC  The next node in a list, or nil\NC\NR
\NC id      \NC number  \NC  The node's type (\type{id}) number \NC\NR
\NC subtype \NC number  \NC  The node \type{subtype} identifier\NC\NR
\stoptabulate

The \type{subtype} is sometimes just a stub entry. Not all nodes
actually use the \type{subtype}, but this way you can be sure that all
nodes accept it as a valid field name, and that is often handy in node
list traversal. In the following tables \type{next} and \type{id} are
not explicitly mentioned.

Besides these three fields, almost all nodes also have an \type {attr}
field, and there is a also a field called \type{prev}. That last field
is always present, but only initialized on explicit request: when the
function \type{node.slide()} is called, it will set up the \type{prev}
fields to be a backwards pointer in the argument node list.

\chapter{Modifications}

Besides the expected changes caused by new functionality, there are a
number of not|-|so|-|expected changes. These are sometimes a side|-|effect
of a new (conflicting) feature, or, more often than not, a change
necessary to clean up the internal interfaces.

\section{Changes from \TEX\ 3.141592}

\startitemize

\item See~\in{chapter}[languages] for many small changes related to paragraph 
  building, language handling, and hyphenation.

\item There is no pool file, all strings are embedded during compilation.

\item \type {plus 1 fillll} does not generate an error. The extra \quote{l} is
simply typeset.

\item The \tex{endlinechar} can be either added (values 0 or more), or not
(negative values). If it is added, the character is always decimal 13 a/k/a
\type{^^M} a/k/a carriage return (This change may be temporary).

\item The banner line and the statistics messages are different, as
well as many warnings and error texts.

\stopitemize

\section{Changes from \ETEX\ 2.2}

\startitemize

\item The \ETEX\ functionality is always present and enabled
   (but see below about \TEXXET), so the prepended asterisk or
   \type{-etex} switch for \INITEX\ is not needed.

\item \TEXXET\ is not present, so the primitives

\starttyping
\TeXXeTstate
\beginR
\beginL
\endR
\endL
\stoptyping

are missing

\item Some of the tracing information that is output by \ETEX's \tex{tracingassigns} and 
  \tex{tracingrestores} is not there.

\item Register management in \LUATEX\ uses the \ALEPH\ model, so the maximum value is 65535
  and the implementation uses a flat array instead of the mixed
 flat|\&|sparse model from \ETEX.

\item \type{savinghyphcodes} is a no-op and may possibly be removed. 
 See~\in{chapter}[languages] for details.

\stopitemize

\section{Changes from \PDFTEX\ 1.40}

\startitemize

\item The (experimental) support for snap nodes has been removed, because 
it is much more natural to build this functionality on top of node
processing and attributes. The associated primitives that are now gone
are: \tex{pdfsnaprefpoint}, \tex{pdfsnapy}, and \tex{pdfsnapycomp}.

\item The (experimental) support for specialized spacing around nodes 
has also been removed. The associated primitives that are now gone are:
\tex{pdfadjustinterwordglue}, \tex{pdfprependkern}, and \tex{pdfappendkern}, 
as well as the five supporting primitives \tex{knbscode}, \tex{stbscode}, 
\tex{shbscode}, \tex{knbccode}, and \tex{knaccode}.



\item A number of \quote{utility functions} is removed:

\startcolumns[n=3]
\starttyping
\pdfelapsedtime
\pdfescapehex
\pdfescapename
\pdfescapestring
\pdffiledump
\pdffilemoddate
\pdffilesize
\pdflastmatch
\pdfmatch
\pdfmdfivesum
\pdfresettimer
\pdfshellescape
\pdfstrcmp
\pdfunescapehex
\stoptyping
\stopcolumns

\item A few other experimental primitives are also provided without the
      extra  \luatex {pdf} prefix, so they can also be called like this:

\startcolumns[n=3]
\starttyping
\primitive
\ifprimitive
\ifabsnum
\ifabsdim
\stoptyping
\stopcolumns

\item The definitions for new didot and new cicero are patched.

\item The \tex{pdfprimitive} is bugfixed.

\item The \tex{pdftexversion} is set to 200.

\stopitemize

\section{Changes from \ALEPH\ RC4}

\startitemize

\item The input translations from \ALEPH\ are not implemented, the
   related primitives are not available

\startcolumns[n=2]
\starttyping
\DefaultInputMode
\noDefaultInputMode
\noInputMode

\OutputMode
\DefaultInputTranslation
\noDefaultInputTranslation
\noInputTranslation

\noOutputTranslation
\OutputTranslation
\stoptyping
\stopcolumns

\item A small series of bounds checking fixes to \tex{ocp} and
   \tex{ocplist} has been added to prevent the system from crashing
   due to array indexes running out of bounds.

\item The \tex{hoffset} bug when \tex{pagedir TRT}  is fixed,
removing the need for an explicit fix to \tex{hoffset}

\item A bug causing \tex{fam} to fail for family numbers above
    15 is fixed.

\item Some bits of \ALEPH\ assumed \type{0} and \type{null} were identical.
This resulted for instance in a bug that sometimes caused an eternal
loop when trying to \tex{show} a box.

\item A fair amount of other minor bugs are fixed as well, most of these
related to \tex{tracingcommands} output.

\item The number of possible fonts, ocps and ocplists is
smaller than their maximum \ALEPH\ value (around 5000 fonts and
30000 ocps / ocplists).

\item The internal function \type{scan_dir()} has been renamed to
\type{scan_direction()} to prevent a naming clash.

\item The \type{^^} notation can come in five and six item repetitions also, to
insert characters that do not fit in the BMP.

\item Glues {\it immediately after} direction change commands are not 
legal breakpoints.

\item The \tex{ocp} and \tex{ocplist} statistics at the end of a run
are only printed if OCP's are actually used.

\stopitemize

\section{Changes from standard \WEBC}

\startitemize

\item There is no mltex

\item There is no enctex

\item The following commandline switches are silently ignored, even
in non|-|\LUA\ mode:

\starttyping
-8bit
-translate-file=TCXNAME
-mltex
-enc
-etex
\stoptyping

\item \tex{openout} whatsits are not written to the log file.

\item Some of the so|-|called web2c extensions are hard to set up
  in non|-|\KPSE\ mode because texmf.cnf is not read: \type{shell-escape}
  is off (but that is not a problem because of \LUA's
  \lua{os.execute}), and the paranoia checks on \type{openin} and
  \type{openout} do not happen (however, it is easy for a \LUA\ script
  to do this itself by overloading \lua{io.open}).

are all aliases of each other.

\section{Memory allocation}

The single internal memory heap that traditional \TEX\ used for tokens
and nodes is split into two separate arrays. Each of these will grow
dynamically when needed.

The \type{texmf.cnf} settings related to main memory are no longer
used (these are: \type{main_memory}, \type{mem_bot},
\type{extra_mem_top} and \type{extra_mem_bot}). \quote{Out of main
memory} errors can still occur, but the limiting factor is now the
amount of RAM in your system, not a predefined limit.

Also, the memory (de)allocation routines for nodes are completely
rewritten. The relevant code now lives in the C file \type{luanode.c},
and basically uses a dozen or so avail lists instead of a
doubly|-|linked model. An extra function layer is added so that the 
code can ask for nodes by type instead of directly requisitioning
a certain amount of memory words.

Because of the split into two arrays and the resulting differences in
the data structures, some of the Pascal \WEB\ macros have been
duplicated.  For instance, there are now \type{vlink} and \type{vinfo}
as well as \type{link} and \type{info}. All access to the variable
memory array is now hidden behind a macro called \type{vmem}.

The implementation of the growth of two arrays (via reallocation)
introduces a potential pitfall: the memory arrays should never be used
as the left hand side of a statement that can modify the array in
question.

The input line buffer and pool size are now also reallocated when
needed, and the \type{texmf.cnf} settings \type{buf_size} and
\type{pool_size} are silently ignored.

\section{Sparse arrays}

The \tex{mathcode}, \tex{delcode}, \tex{catcode},
\tex{sfcode}, \tex{lccode} and \tex{uccode} tables are now
sparse arrays that are implemented in~C. They are no longer part of
the \TEX\ \quote{equivalence table} and because each had 1.1 million
entries with a few memory words each, this makes a major difference
in memory usage.

These assignments do not yet show up when using the etex tracing
routines \tex{tracingassigns} and \tex{tracingrestores} (code
simply not written yet)

A side|-|effect of the current implementation is that \tex{global} is
now more expensive in terms of processing than non|-|global assignments.

See \type{mathcodes.c} and \type{textcodes.c} if you are interested in
the details.

Also, the glyph ids within a font are now managed by means
of a sparse array and glyph ids can go up to index $2^{21}-1$.

\section{Simple single-character csnames}

Single|-|character commands are no longer treated specially in the
internals, they are stored in the hash just like the multiletter
csnames.

The code that displays control sequences explicitly checks if
the length is one when it has to decide whether or not to add a
trailing space.

\section{Compressed format}

The format is passed through zlib, allowing it to shrink to roughly
half of the size it would have had in uncompressed form. This takes a
bit more CPU cycles but much less disk I/O, so it should still be
faster.

\section{Binary file reading}

All of the internal code is changed in such a way that if one of the
\type{read_xxx_file} callbacks is not set, then the file is read by
a C function using basically the same convention as the callback: a
single read into a buffer big enough to hold the entire file
contents. While this uses more memory than the previous code (that
mostly used \type{getc} calls), it can be quite a bit faster
(depending on your I/O subsystem).

\chapter{Known bugs and limitations}

The bugs below are going to be fixed eventually.

The top ones will be fixed soon, but in the later items either the
actual problem is hard to find, or the code that causes the bug is
going to be replaced by a new subsystem soon anyway, or it may not
be worth the hassle and the limitations will eventually be documented.

\startitemize

\item The current linebreaking implementation does not yet take all 
possible breakpoints into account where ligatures are involved in
the process.  This means that line breaks may change in future
versions.

\item Sometimes font loading via fontforge generates a message like this
\starttyping
Bad call to gww_iconv_open, neither arg is UCS4 (EUC-CN->UTF-8)
\stoptyping
during font loading. This is a limitation of the internal iconv
implementation.

\item Font expansion does not work quite as it should. On the mailing
list (sep 21), Jonathan Sauer posted a very nice test file along with
an explanation. 

\item \luatex{tex.print()} and \luatex{tex.sprint()} do not work if
\tex{directlua} is used in an \OTP\ file (in the output of an
\type{expression} rule).

\item Handling of attributes in math mode is not complete. The data
structures in math mode are quite different from those in text mode,
so this will take some extra effort to implement correctly.

\item When used inside  \type{\directlua}, \type{pdf.print()} should create a
literal node instead of flushing immediately.

\item At the moment, only characters in plane~0 and plane~1 can be
assigned catcode~13 (i.e. turned into active characters). This is a
temporary measure to reduce the memory requirements of \LUATEX.  In
general, \LUATEX's memory footprint is a bit larger that we would
like (with \type{plain.fmt} preloaded it needs about 55MB).

\item Not all of \ALEPH's direction commands are handled properly in
\PDF\ mode, and especially the vertical scripts support is missing
almost completely (only TRT and TLT are routinely tested).

\item Letter spacing (\tex{letterspacefont}) is currently non|-|functional
due to massive changes in the virtual font handling. This
functionality may actually be removed completely in the future,
because it is straightforward to set up letterspacing using the \LUA\
\quote{define_font} interface.

\item Node pointers are not always checked for validity, so if you make a 
mistake in the node list processing, \LUATEX\ may terminate itself with an
assertion error or \quote{Emergency stop}.

\item In \DVI\ generation mode, using a \type{\textdir} switch inside the
preamble of a \type{\halign} results in overprinted text in the \DVI\ file,
because the column width is not taken into account during the final
placement phase (this is a bug inherited from \ALEPH). Also, \ALEPH\
apparently dislikes having more than one non-grouped \type{\textdir}
command in a single lined paragraph.

\item Certain constructs in math mode leak memory nodes. 

\stopitemize


\chapter{TODO}

On top of the \quote{normal} extensions that are planned, there are
some more specific small feature requests. Whether these will all be
included is not certain yet, (and new requests are welcome).

\startitemize

\item Implement the \TEX\ primitive \tex{dimension}, cf.\ \tex{number}

\item Change the \LUA\ table \type{tex.dimen} to accept and return float
values instead of strings

\item Do something about \tex{withoutpt} and/or a new register type \tex{real}?

\item Create callback for the automatic creation of missing
characters in fonts

\item Implement the \TEX\ primitive \tex{htdp}?
